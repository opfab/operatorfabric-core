== Introduction

//tag::short_description[]
OperatorFabric is a modular, extensible, industrial-strength platform for use in electricity, water, and other utility operations.

It aims to facilitate operational activities for utilities in two ways :

* Centralize real time business events in a single place to avoid having multiple screens/software. To do so,  OperatorFabric provides 
** event notifications named "cards"  with filtering features (severity , date , process ... )
** event dispatching rules on a per user basis (based on groups, organizational entities, processes... )
** event-sending endpoints for business applications 
** a mechanism of templating to customize events rendering (using HTML5 )
** a view of the events on a timeline and agenda view 
** storage of all the events (archive feature)
** notifications via sounds 
** possibilities  to integrate screen form other applications

    
* Facilitate interactions between operational control centers:
** Share information in real time, as pre-formatted cards that can be sent either manually by operators or automatically by external solutions.
** Introduce pre-formatted question/response exchanges between control centers. This can be used to implement operational processes (with the notion of "last time to respond").  
** Share events in calendar (also allowing repeating events)

In addition, the following features are available :  internationalization, time-zone management, light/dark mode for the UI,  authorization mechanism.

Integration with existing IT systems is an overarching concern: support of Firefox and Chromium-based browsers, docker deployment, communication with business applications via REST API or Kafka, integration with external authentication systems (via OAuth2), monitoring via Prometheus endpoints.


OperatorFabric is part of the https://www.lfenergy.org/[LF Energy] coalition, a project of The Linux Foundation that
supports open source innovation projects within the energy and electricity sectors.

== Try it!

If you want to try OperatorFabric (see what the UI looks like with some test cards) in a few minutes, follow the steps below.

. Clone this repository
+
----
git clone https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core.git
cd operatorfabric-core
----

. Launch our demo docker-compose file
+
----
cd ./config/docker
./docker-compose.sh
----

. After a little while, log into the application UI at *localhost:2002/ui/* using admin/test as credentials.
+
WARNING: Don't forget the *final slash* in the URL or you will get an error.

. Push cards using the following test script
+
----
./services/core/cards-publication/src/main/bin/push_card_loop.sh --publisher TEST --process process
----

TIP: If you want to experiment in more depth and have more details on how it works (as well as some troubleshooting), check out our

== Technology stack

=== Development

OperatorFabric is mostly written in Java and based on the Spring framework. This makes writing and integrating software for a simplified and better coordination very easy.
