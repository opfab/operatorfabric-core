== Introduction

//tag::short_description[]
OperatorFabric is a modular, extensible, industrial-strength and field-tested
platform for use in electricity, water, and other utility operations.

* System visualization and console integration
* Precise alerting
* Workflow scheduling
* Historian
* Scripting (ex: Python, JavaScript)

NOTE: Workflow Scheduling could be addressed either as an internal module or
through simplified and standardized (BPMN) integration with external workflow
engines, we're still weighing the pros and cons of the two options._

OperatorFabric is part of the https://www.lfenergy.org/[LF Energy] coalition, a project of The Linux Foundation that
supports open source innovation projects within the energy and electricity sectors.

OpFab is an open source platform licensed under https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/[Mozilla Public License V2].
The source code is hosted on GitHub in this repository : https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core[operatorfabric-core].

== Try it!

If you want to try OperatorFabric (see what the UI looks like with some test cards) in a few minutes, follow the steps below.

. Clone this repository
+
----
git clone https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core.git
cd operatorfabric-core
----

. Launch our demo docker-compose file
+
----
./config/docker/docker-compose.sh
----

. After a little while, log into the application UI at *localhost:2002/ui/* using admin/test as credentials.
+
WARNING: Don't forget the *final slash* in the URL or you will get an error.

. Push cards using the following test script
+
----
./services/core/cards-publication/src/main/bin/push_card_loop.sh --publisher TEST --process process
----

TIP: If you want to experiment in more depth and have more details on how it works (as well as some troubleshooting), check out our

== Technology stack

=== Development

OperatorFabric is mostly written in Java and based on the Spring framework. This makes writing and integrating software for a simplified and better coordination very easy.
