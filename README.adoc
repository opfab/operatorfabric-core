OperatorFabric is a modular, extensible, industrial-strength and field-tested platform for use in electricity, water, and other utility operations.

* System visualization and console integration
* Precise alerting
* Workflow scheduling
* Historian
* Scripting (ex: Python, JavaScript)

It is an open source project initiated by http://www.rte-france.com/[RTE] with https://www.lfenergy.org/[LF Energy].

== What does OperatorFabric do in practice?

To perform their duties, an operator has to interact with multiple applications (perform actions, watch for alerts, etc.), which can prove difficult if there are too many of them.

The idea is to aggregate all the notifications from all these applications into a single screen, and to allow the operator to act on them if needed.

image:feed_details_1.png[Feed screen layout,450,300,align="center"]

These notifications are materialized by *cards* sorted in a *feed* according to their period of relevance and their severity.
When a card is selected in the feed, the right-hand pane displays the *details* of the card: information about the state of the parent process instance in the third-party application that published it, available actions, etc.

In addition, the cards will also translate as events displayed on a *timeline* (its design is still under discussion) at the top of the screen.
This view will be complimentary to the card feed in that it will allow the operator to see at a glance the status of processes for a given period, when the feed is more like a "To Do" list.

Part of the value of OperatorFabric is that it makes the integration very simple on the part of the third-party applications.
To start publishing cards to users in an Opera,torFabric instance, all they have to do is:

* Register as a publisher through the "Thirds" service and provide a "bundle" containing handlebars templates defining how cards should be rendered, i18n info etc.
* Publish cards as json containing card data through the card publication API

OperatorFabric will then:

* Dispatch the cards to the appropriate users (by computing the actual users who should receive the card from the recipients rules defined in the card)
* Take care of the rendering of the cards, displaying details, actions, inputs etc.
* Display relevant information from the cards in the timeline

Another aim of OperatorFabric is to make cooperation easier by letting operators forward or send cards to other operators, for example:

* If they need an input from another operator
* If they can't handle a given card for lack of time or because the necessary action is out of their scope

This will replace phone calls or emails, making cooperation more efficient and traceable.

For instance, operators might be interested in knowing why a given decision was made in the past:
the cards detailing the decision process steps will be accessible through the Archives screen, showing how the
operators reached this agreement.

== Licensing

This project and all its sub-projects are licensed under https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/[Mozilla Public License V2.0]. See link:LICENSE.txt[LICENSE.txt]

== Contributing

Read our link:https://github.com/opfab/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING] file for more information on how to contribute to the project.

== Requirements

IMPORTANT: This section describes the projects requirements regardless of installation options.
Please see <<Getting Started>> below for details on:

* setting up a development environment with these prerequisites
* building and running OperatorFabric

=== Tools and libraries

* Gradle 5 +
* Java 8.0.163-zulu +
* Maven 3.5.3 +
* Docker
* Docker Compose with 2.1+ file format support
* Chrome (needed for UI tests in build)

NOTE: Java 8.0.163-zulu is no longer available for security reasons, the next version is Java 8.0.192-zulu.

IMPORTANT: It is highly recommended to use https://sdkman.io/[sdkman] and
https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm] to manage tools versions.

Once you have installed sdkman and nvm, you can **source** the following script to set up your development environment (appropriate versions of gradle, java, maven and project variables set):

.Set up development environment (using sdkman and nvm)
[source]
----
source bin/load_environment_light.sh
----

=== Software

* link:RABBITMQ.md[RabbitMQ 3.7.6 +]: AMQP messaging layer allows inter service communication
* MongoDB 4.0 +: Card persistent storage

RabbitMQ is required for :

* Time change push
* Card AMQP push
* Multiple service sync

MongoDB is required for :

* Current Card storage
* Archived Card storage
* User Storage

IMPORTANT: Installing MongoDB and RabbitMQ is not necessary as preconfigured MongoDB and RabbitMQ are available in the form of docker-compose configuration files at
link:src/main/docker[src/main/docker]

=== Browser support

We currently use Firefox (63.0.3). Automatic tests for the UI rely on Chrome (73.0.3683.86).

== Getting Started

WARNING: The steps below assume that you are using https://sdkman.io/[sdkman] and
https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm] to manage tools versions and that you have already installed them.

WARNING: Before running containers with docker-compose, it is required to configure a docker network for them using `docker network create opfabnet`. You can also use the bin/setup_dockerized_environment which builds the services images ant sets up the `opfabnet` network.

There are several ways to get started with OperatorFabric. Please look into the section that best fits your needs.

TIP: If you encounter any issue, see <<Troubleshooting>> below. In particular, a command that hangs then fails is often a proxy issue.

=== Build and run using script

+++ <details><summary> +++
**See detailed steps**
+++ </summary><div> +++

These steps describe how to use dockerized Mongo, RabbitMQ and SonarQube and build and run OperatorFabric using the `run_all.sh` script.

.Clone repository
----
git clone https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core.git
cd operatorfabric-core
----

.Set up your environment (environment variables & appropriate versions of gradle, maven, etc.)
----
source ./bin/load_environment_light.sh
----

TIP: From now on, you can use environment variable $OF_HOME to get back to the repository home.

.Deploy dockerized MongoDB, RabbitMQ and SonarQube
MongoDB, RabbitMQ and SonarQube are needed for the build so tests can be run.

A docker-compose file with properly configured containers is available link:src/main/docker/test-quality-environment/[there].

If you haven't done so before, you will need to configure a docker network for the containers:
----
docker network create opfabnet
----

Then run the docker-compose in detached mode:
----
cd src/main/docker/test-quality-environment/
docker-compose up -d
----

.Build and run OperatorFabric Services using the `run_all.sh` script
----
cd $OF_HOME
./bin/run_all.sh -s users,time,cards-publication,cards-consultation,thirds -b true start
----

TIP: See `run_all.sh -h` for details.

.Check services status
----
./bin/run_all.sh -s users,time,cards-publication,cards-consultation,thirds status
----

.Log into the UI

URL: localhost:2002/ui/

login: admin

password: test

WARNING: It might take a little while for the UI to load even after all services are running.

WARNING: Don't forget the *final slash* in the URL or you will get an error.

.Push cards to the feed

You can check that you see cards into the feed by running the `push_card_loop.sh` script.
----
./services/core/cards-publication/src/main/bin/push_card_loop.sh
----

+++ </div></details> +++

=== Demonstration mode

If you only want a quick demonstration of what OperatorFabric looks like and what it can do, use our standalone docker demo.
See <<Docker Demo>> for details.

=== Going Further

When you feel ready to experiment with the project, or if the steps above don't quite cover what you're planning to do, please look into the <<Recipes>> section.

TIP: In addition, we now have a link:https://opfab.github.io/documentation/0.1.1.RELEASE/start/[Getting Started guide on our website], check it out.

=== Conventions regarding project structure and configuration

Sub-projects must conform to a few rules in order for the configured Gradle tasks to work:

==== Java

[horizontal]
[sub-project]/src/main/java:: contains java source code
[sub-project]/src/test/java:: contains java tests source code
[sub-project]/src/main/resources:: contains resource files
[sub-project]/src/test/resources:: contains test resource files

==== Modeling

Core services projects declaring REST APIS that use Swagger for their definition must declare two files:

[horizontal]
[sub-project]/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml:: Swagger API definition
[sub-project]/src/main/modeling/config.json:: Swagger generator configuration

==== Docker

Services project all have docker image generated in their build cycle (See <<Gradle Tasks>>).

Per project configuration :

* docker file : *[sub-project]/src/main/docker/Dockerfile*
* docker-compose file : *[sub-project]/src/main/docker/docker-compose.yml*
* runtime data : *[sub-project]/src/main/docker/volume* is copied to
*[sub-project]/build/docker-volume/* by task *copyWorkingDir*. The latest
can then be mounted as volume in docker containers.

=== Scripts (bin)

[horizontal]
bin/build_all.sh:: builds all artifacts as gradle is not able to manage inter project dependencies
bin/clean_all.sh:: remove IDE data (project configuration, build output directory) - idea, vsc
bin/load_environment_light.sh:: sets up environment when *sourced* (java version, gradle version, maven version, node version)
bin/load_environment_ramdisk.sh:: sets up environment and links build subdirectories to a ramdisk when *sourced* at ~/tmp
bin/run_all.sh:: runs all all services (see below)
bin/setup_dockerized_environment.sh:: generate docker images for all services

==== load_environment_ramdisk.sh

There are prerequisites before sourcing load_environment_ramdisk.sh:

* Logged user needs sudo rights for mount
* System needs to have enough free ram

CAUTION: Never ever run a `gradle clean` to avoid deleting those links.

==== run_all.sh

Please see `run_all.sh -h` usage before running.

Prerequisites

* mongo running on port 27017 with user "root" and password "password"
(See src/main/docker/mongodb/docker-compose.yml for a pre configured instance).
* rabbitmq running on port 5672 with user "guest" and password "guest"
(See src/main/docker/rabbitmq/docker-compose.yml for a pre configured instance).

== Recipes

=== Generating docker images

To Generate all docker images run `bin/setup_dockerized_environment`,
it will generate all images and also generate an opfabnet docker network

INFORMATION: If you work behind a proxy you need to specify the following properties to
configure alpine apk package manager:

* apk.proxy.uri: proxy http uri ex: "http://somewhere:3128[http://somewhere:3128]" (defaults to blank)
* apk.proxy.httpsuri: proxy http uri ex: "http://somewhere:3128[http://somewhere:3128]" (defaults to apk.proxy.uri value)
* apk.proxy.user: proxy user
* apk.proxy.password: proxy *unescaped* password

Alternatively, you may configure the following environment variables :

* APK_PROXY_URI
* APK_PROXY_HTTPS_URI
* APK_PROXY_USER
* APK_PROXY_PASSWORD

=== Managing a service with docker-compose

Prerequisites : images must be registered

* To deploy a service run `gradle :[subprojectPath]:composeUp`
example for the third-party-service service :
`
gradle :services:core:third-party-service:composeUp
`
* To tear down a service run `gradle :[subprojectPath]:composeDown`
* To start an already containerized service run `gradle :[subprojectPath]:composeStart`
* To stop an already containerized service run `gradle :[subprojectPath]:composeStop`
* To follow logs of a running service run `gradle :[subprojectPath]:composeLog`

=== Running sub-project from jar file

* gradle :[sub-projectPath]:bootJar
* or java -jar [sub-projectPath]/build/libs/[sub-project].jar

=== Overriding properties when running from jar file

* java -jar [sub-projectPath]/build/libs/[sub-project].jar –spring.config.additional-location=file:[filepath]
NB : properties may be set using ".properties" file or ".yml" file. See https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html[Spring Boot configuration] for more info.
* Generic property list extract :
** server.port (defaults to 8080) : embedded server port
* :services:core:third-party-service properties list extract :
** thirds.storage.path (defaults to &quot;&quot;) : where to save/load OperatorFabric Third Party data

=== Service port table

By default all service built artifacts are configured with server.port set to 8080

If you run the services using `bootRun` gradle task or the provided docker-compose files (see [prj]/src/main/docker) the ports used are

[cols="<,>,>,>"]

**Proxy error when running third-party docker-compose**
+++ </summary><div> +++

.Error message

.Possible causes & resolution
When running docker-compose files using third-party images(such as rabbitmq, mongodb etc.) the first time, docker will need to pull these images from their repositories.
If the docker proxy isn't set properly, you will see the above message.

To set the proxy, follow https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/[these steps from the docker documentation].

If your proxy needs authentication, add your user and password as follows:

+++ </summary><div> +++
When sourcing the link:bin/load_environment_light.sh[load_environment_light] script to set up your environment, you might get the following error message:

.Error message

----
Stop! java 8.0.192-zulu is not available. Possible causes:
 * 8.0.192-zulu is an invalid version
 * java binaries are incompatible with Linux64
 * java has not been released yet
----

Select the next available version and update link:bin/load_environment_light.sh[load_environment_light] accordingly before sourcing it again.

.Possible causes & resolution
The java version currently listed in the script might have been deprecated (for security reasons) or might not be available for your operating system (for example, 8.0.192-zulu wasn't available for Ubuntu).

Run `sdk list java` to find out which versions are available. You will get this kind of output:
