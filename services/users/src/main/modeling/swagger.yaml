            Size of the results pages.
            If "size" is set but "page" isn't, the default page returned will be the first (number 0).
            If "page" is set but "size" isn't, the default size will be 10 items.
            If neither "page" nor "size" is set, the response will contain a single page containing all matching cards.
            This parameter should be unique or a BAD REQUEST will be returned.
