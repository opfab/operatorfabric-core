A new operator call John Doe, who has OAuth granted right to connect ot current `OperatorFabric` instance, need to receive cards within current `OperatorFabric` instance. As a user of OperatorFabric, he needes to be added to the system with a `login` (john-doe-opertaor), his `firstName` (John) and his `lastName` (Doe).
opertaor
As there is no `Administration GUI` for the moment, it must be performed through command line, as specify link:https://opfab.github.io/projects/services/core/users/0.13.1.RELEASE/api/#SimpleUser[here].

=== List all users

First of all, list the users (who are the recipients in OperatorFabric) of the system with the following commands:

Httpie
....
http http://localhost:2103/groups "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/type"
....
cURL
....
curl -v http://localhost:2103/users -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/type"
....

response
....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

[
    {
        "firstName": null,
        "groups": [
            "ADMIN"
        ],
        "lastName": null,
        "login": "admin"
    },
    {
        "firstName": null,
        "groups": [
            "RTE",
            "ADMIN",
            "CORESO",
            "TRANS",
            "TEST"
        ],
        "lastName": null,
        "login": "rte-operator"
    },
    {
        "firstName": null,
        "groups": [
            "ELIA"
        ],
        "lastName": null,
        "login": "elia-operator"
    },
    {
        "firstName": null,
        "groups": [
            "CORESO"
        ],
        "lastName": null,
        "login": "coreso-operator"
    },
    {
        "firstName": null,
        "groups": [
            "TSO1",
            "TRANS",
            "TEST"
        ],
        "lastName": null,
        "login": "tso1-operator"
    },
    {
        "firstName": null,
        "groups": [
            "TSO2",
            "TRANS"
        ],
        "lastName": null,
        "login": "tso2-operator"
    },
]
....

=== Create a new User

We are sure that no John-doe-operator exists in our OperatorFabric instance. We can add him in our OperatorFabric instance using the following command use httpie:
....
echo '{"login":"john-doe-operator","firstName":"Jahne","lastName":"Doe"}' | http POST http://localhost:2103/users "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/json"
....
Or here cURL:
....
curl -X POST http://localhost:2103/users -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"login":"john-doe-operator","firstName":"Jahne","lastName":"Doe"}'
....
response
....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "firstName": "Jahne",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "login": "john-doe-operator"
}
....

=== Fetch user details

It's always a good thing to verify if all the information has been correctely recorded in the system:

with httpie:
....
http -b http://localhost:2103/users/john-doe-operator "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/json"
....

or with cURL:
....
http://localhost:2103/users/test-login-operator -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
....

response
....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "firstName": "Jahne",
    "groups": [],
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "login": "john-doe-operator"
}
....

=== Update user details

As shown by this result, the firstName of the new operator has been mispelled.We need link:https://opfab.github.io/projects/services/core/users/0.13.1.RELEASE/api/#updateUser[to update the existing user] with `john-doe-operator` login. To correct this mistake, the following commands can be usedÂ :

with httpie:
....
echo '{"login":"john-doe-operator","lastName":"Doe","firstName":"John"}' | http PUT http://localhost:2103/users/john-doe-operator "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/json"
....

or with cURL:
....
curl -X PUT http://localhost:2103/users/john-doe-operator -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"login":"john-doe-operator","firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe"}'
....

response
....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "login": "john-doe-operator"
}
....

=== List groups

This operator is the first member of a new group operator called the `OPERATORS`, which doesn't exist for the moment in the system. As shown when we link:https://opfab.github.io/projects/services/core/users/0.13.1.RELEASE/api/#fetchGroups[lists the groups existing in the server].

Httpie
....
http http://localhost:2103/groups "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/type"
....

cURL
....
curl http://localhost:2103/groups -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
....

response
....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

[
    {
        "description": "The admin group",
        "name": "ADMIN"
    },
    {
        "description": "RTE TSO Group",
        "name": "RTE"
    },
    {
        "description": "ELIA TSO group",
        "name": "ELIA"
    },
    {
        "description": "CORESO Group",
        "name": "CORESO"
    },
    {
        "description": "TSO 1 Group",
        "name": "TSO1"
    },
    {
        "description": "TSO 2 Group",
        "name": "TSO2"
    },
    {
        "description": "Transnationnal Group",
        "name": "TRANS"
    }
]
....

=== Create a new Group

Firstly, the group called `OPERATORS` has link:https://opfab.github.io/projects/services/core/users/0.13.1.RELEASE/api/#createGroup[to be added to the system] using the following command:

using httpie:
....
echo '{"name":"OPERATORS","decription":"This is the brand new  group of operator"}' | http POST http://localhost:2103/groups "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/json"
....

using cURL:
....
curl -X POST http://localhost:2103/groups -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"name":"OPERATORS","decription":"This is the brand new  group of operator"}' 
....

response
....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "description": null,
    "name": "OPERATORS"
}
....

=== Fetch details of a given group

The result return seems strange, to verify if it's the correct answer by link:https://opfab.github.io/projects/services/core/users/0.13.1.RELEASE/api/#fetchGroup[displaying the details of the group] called `OPERATORS`, use the following command:

using httpie:
....
http http://localhost:2103/groups/OPERATORS "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/json"
....

using cURL:
....
curl http://localhost:2103/groups/OPERATORS -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
....

response
....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "description": null,
    "name": "OPERATORS"
}
....

=== Update details of a group

The description is really null. After verification, in our first command used to create the group, the attribut for the description is misspelled. Using the following command link:https://opfab.github.io/projects/services/core/users/0.13.1.RELEASE/api/#updateGroup[to update the group], with the correct spelling, the new group of operator gets a proper description:

with httpie:
....
echo '{"name":"OPERATORS","description":"This is the brand new  group of operator"}' | http -b PUT http://localhost:2103/groups/OPERATORS "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/json"
....

with cURL:
....
http -b PUT http://localhost:2103/groups/OPERATORS -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data '{"name":"OPERATORS","description":"This is the brand new  group of operator"}' 
....

response
....
{
    "description": "This is the brand new  group of operator",
    "name": "OPERATORS"
}
....

=== Add a user to a group

As both new group and new user are correct it's time link:https://opfab.github.io/projects/services/core/users/0.13.1.RELEASE/api/#addGroupUsers[to make the user member of the group]. To achieve this, use the following command:

with httpie:
....
echo '["john-doe-operator"]' | http POST http://localhost:2103/groups/OPERATORS/users "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/json"
....

with cURL:
....
http POST http://localhost:2103/groups/OPERATORS/users -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json" --data '["john-doe-operator"]' 
....

response
....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
....

Let's verify that the changes are correctelly recorded by fetching the :
....
http http://localhost:2103/users/john-doe-operator "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/json"
....

with cURL
....
curl http://localhost:2103/users/john-doe-operator -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
....

response
....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "firstName": "John",
    "groups": ["OPERATORS"],
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "login": "john-doe-operator"
}
....

It's now possible to send cards either specifically to `john-doe-operator` or more generally to the `OPERATORS` group.

=== Remove a user from a Group

When John Doe is no longer in charge of hypervising cards for `OPERATORS` group, this group has to be remove from his login by using the following command:

with httpie:
....
echo '["john-doe-operator"]' | http DELETE http://localhost:2103/groups/OPERATORS/users "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/json"
....

with cURL:
....
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:2103/users/john-doe-operator
....

response
....

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
	"login":"john-doe-operator","
	firstName":"John",
	"lastName":"Doe",
	"groups":[]
}

....
A last command to verify that `OPERATORS` is no longer linked to `john-doe-operator`:

with httpie:
....
http http://localhost:2103/users/john-doe-operator "Authorization:Bearer $token" "Content-Type:application/json"
....

with cURL:
....
curl http://localhost:2103/users/john-doe-operator -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" -H "Content-Type:application/json"
....

response
....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
    "firstName": "John",
    "groups": [],
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "login": "coreso-operator"

}
....
