_We have transitioned from a GitHub flow to a Git flow. See the documentation to see how it impacted our
link:./single_page_doc.html#CICD[CICD pipeline]
and how it translate into our link:./single_page_doc.html#_contribution_workflow[contribution workflow]
(submitting a pull request etc.)._
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
_Now, the current state of developments is pushed daily to Docker Hub with the tag `SNAPSHOT`
(rather than `snapshot` as before)._
====

* [OC-836] Remove netflix stack (eureka registry server) and config server for thirds microservice
* [OC-888] Fix SonarCloud Frontend issues
* [OC-692] Fix SonarCloud Backend issues
* [OC-891] Removed mainRecipient
* [OC-899] Deploy docker-compose should use SNAPSHOT version on develop branch
+
_When working on branch `develop`, the `deploy` docker-compose will rely on `SNAPSHOT` docker images generated daily.
This lets you test OperatorFabric with the latest merged code. If you're interested in running a particular release on
the other hand, you should checkout the associated X.X.X.RELEASE tag on `master`._
