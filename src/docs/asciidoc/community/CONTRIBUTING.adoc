= Contributing

Thank you for your interest !

We can't stress enough that feedback, discussions, questions and contributions on OperatorFabric are very much
appreciated.
However, because the project is still in its early stages, we're not fully equipped for any of it yet, so please bear
with us while the contribution process and tooling are sorted out.

== Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<code_of_conduct, OperatorFabric Code of Conduct>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/community/index.adoc#code_of_conduct, OperatorFabric Code of Conduct>>]
.
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behavior to mailto:opfab_AT_lists.lfenergy.org[opfab_AT_lists.lfenergy.org].

== License and Developer Certificate of Origin

OperatorFabric is an open source project licensed under the link:https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/[Mozilla Public License 2.0].
By contributing to OperatorFabric, you accept and agree to the terms and conditions for your present and future
contributions submitted to OperatorFabric.

The project also uses a mechanism known as a link:https://developercertificate.org/[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)]
to ensure that we are legally allowed to distribute all the code and assets for the project. A DCO is a legally binding
statement that asserts that you are the author of your contribution, and that you wish to allow OperatorFabric to use
your work.

Contributors sign-off that they adhere to these requirements by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to commit messages. All
commits to any repository of the OperatorFabric organization have to be signed-off like this:

----
This is my commit message.

Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@email-provider.com>
----

You can write it manually but Git has a -s command line option to append it automatically to your commit message:

----
$ git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'
----

Note that in the future a check will be performed during the integration, making sure all commits in the Pull Request
contain a valid `Signed-off-by` line.

== How Can I Contribute ?

These processes and templates have been adapted from the ones defined by the link:https://github.com/powsybl[PowSyBl]
project.

=== Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Enhancements

Work in Progress
//TODO Describe JIRA workflows and how to sign up/login

=== Contributing Code

==== Code Guidelines

//TODO add style guidelines
//TODO Organize/reword section
//TODO Update PR template to link back to this sections for rules to be checked before merging

* We don't mention specific authors by name in each file (in Javadoc or in the
documentation for example), so has not to have to maintain these mentions (since this
information is tracked by git anyway).

* If you are working on a JIRA issue:
** Please name your branch with the corresponding JIRA issue ID: OC-XXX
** Start all your commit messages with [OC-XXX]
+
This allows the branch, PR and commits to be directly accessible from the JIRA issue.

* Before submitting your PR, please rebase your branch against the current master to minimize conflicts when merging.
+
```
git checkout OC-XXX
git fetch
git rebase origin/master
```

* Before submitting your PR, please squash/fix your commits so as to reduce the
number of commits and comment them accordingly. In the end, the division of changes
into commits should make the PR easier to understand and review.


* Feel free to add a copyright header (on top of the existing ones) to files
you create or amend. See src/main/headers for examples.

==== Contribution Process

Code Contribution is tracked as link:https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests[GitHub Pull Requests].
Crafting a good pull request takes time and energy and we will help as much as we can, but be prepared to follow our
iterative process. The iterative process has several goals:

* Maintain the quality of the project
* Fix issues that are important to users
* Allow everyone from the community to take part in the discussions, to reach the best possible solution
* Make the review by OperatorFabric maintainers as efficient as possible

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

//TODO Create new pull request template and link to it here
//TODO add status checks
. Request a GitHub review by one of the core developers
. Take their review into account or discuss the requested changes. Please don't take criticism personally, it is normal
to iterate on this step several times.
. Repeat step 3 until the pull request is merged!

Continuous integration is set up to run on all branches automatically and will often report problems, so don't worry
about getting everything perfect on the first try (SonarCloud Analysis is a notorious problem source).
Until you add a reviewer, you can trigger as many builds as you want by amending your commits. The status checks
enforce the following:

* All tests in the test suite pass
* Checkstyle and SonarCloud report no violations (coming soon)
* The code coverage is high enough (currently about 85%) (coming soon)

== Project Governance

=== Project Owner

OperatorFabric is part of the link:https://www.lfenergy.org/[LF Energy Foundation], a project of the
link:https://www.linuxfoundation.org/[Linux Foundation] that supports open source innovation projects within the energy
and electricity sectors.

=== Committers

Committers are contributors who have made several valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to both
write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. In many cases they are programmers but it
is also possible that they contribute in a different role. Typically, a committer will focus on a specific aspect of
the project, and will bring a level of expertise and understanding that earns them the respect of the community and the
project owner.

=== Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is composed of voting members elected by the active Committers as described in
the project’s Technical Charter.

OperatorFabric TSC voting members are:

* link:https://github.com/0x62646f727465[Boris Dolley]
* link:https://github.com/francoisjolain[François Jolain]
* link:https://github.com/AlexGuironnetRTE[Alexandra Guironnet]
* link:https://github.com/HanaeSafiRTE[Hanae Safi]
* Guillaume Trimbach

Boris Dolley will chair the TSC, with Hanae Safi as his deputy.

=== Contributors

Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical
artifacts to the project.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements
and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that
are beneficial to the project.

== Communication channels

In addition to GitHub we have set up:

=== Website: http://opfab.org

Our website contains all the documentation and resources we're currently working on. Here is what we aim to provide:

* Architecture documentation
* REST API documentation
* Reference documentation for each component
* Javadoc/Compodoc for each component
* Tutorials and QuickStart guides and videos

*This documentation is our priority* right now so future contributors can quickly find their way around the project.
Needless to say, it's a work in progress so feel free to tell us what you feel is missing or what type of documentation
you would be interested in as a contributor.

TIP: We also use this website to broadcast any news we have about the project so don't hesitate to subscribe to the
RSS feed on the home page to be informed of any update.

=== Spectrum Community : https://spectrum.chat/opfab
