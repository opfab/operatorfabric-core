= Contribution Workflow

== Principles

=== Release names 

We use the following naming convention for our releases:

 - `X.0.0.RELEASE` for major release (e.g. 1.0.0.RELEASE)
 - `X.X.0.RELEASE` for minor release (e.g. 1.2.0.RELEASE)
 - `X.X.X.RELEASE` for patch releases (e.g. 3.2.1.RELEASE)


=== `develop` branch

The `develop` branch is where feature branches are branched off from, and where they're merged back to. This way,
the HEAD of the `develop` branch always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next
release.

The repository version on the `develop` branch should always be `SNAPSHOT`.

A daily CRON GitHub Action generating the documentation and docker images for the `SNAPSHOT` version is run from
this branch.

=== `X.X.release` branch

When the source code in the develop branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all the changes
should be integrated in a release branch named X.X.release.


=== Feature branches

Feature branches are used to develop new features or fix bugs described in GitHub issues.
They have two distinct use cases with similar workflows.

==== Feature branches for major/minor version

These feature branches are used to develop new features or fix bugs *for the next release*.

Their lifecycle is as follows:

. A new feature branch is branched off `develop` before starting work on a feature or bug.
. Once the developments are deemed ready by the developer(s) working on the feature, a pull request should be created
for this branch.
. New pull requests are discussed during daily meetings to assign someone from the Reviewers group to the issue.
. The pull request author and reviewer(s) then make use of the
link:https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests[Git Hub pull requests]
features (comments, proposed changes, etc.) to make changes to the PR until it meets the project requirements.
. Once it is ready to be included in the next version, the pull request is then merged back into `develop`.

==== Feature branches for patch versions

These feature branches fix bugs in existing releases and give rise to new patches.

Their lifecycle is similar to regular feature branches, except they should be branched off (and merged back to) the
`X.X.release` branch corresponding to the release they are fixing.

Example: A feature branch working on bug 1234 affecting version 1.8.0.RELEASE should be branched off
branch `1.8.release`.

==== Common conventions

*Naming convention:* Feature branches names should always start with "FE-" followed by the reference of the GitHub issue
they're addressing, followed by additional information to give context. 

.Examples of valid feature branch names:
* FE-123-AddMailNotification
* FE-123-FixIssueWithMailNotification
* FE-123-RefactorBundleCompression

.Examples of invalid feature branch names:
* 123
* FE-123
* SomeTextDescribingTheBranch

Commit messages should also contain the GitHub issue reference: ` My commit message (#123)`

This allows the branch, PR and commits to be directly accessible from the GitHub issue.


== Examples and commands

The aim of this section is to illustrate how our workflow works on a concrete example, complete with the required
`git` commands.

=== Starting work on a new feature for the next version

Let's say we want to start working on a feature described in GitHub issue #123.

----
git checkout develop <1>
git pull <2>
git checkout -b FE-123 <3>
----
<1> Check out the `develop` branch
<2> Make sure it is up to date with the remote (=GitHub repository)
<3> Create a `FE-123` off the `develop` branch

Then, you can start working on the feature and commit your work to the branch. Referencing the issue you're working
on at the end of the commit message allows the commit to be listed on the issue's page for future reference.

----
git commit -s -m "Short message describing content of commit (#123)"
----

NOTE: The -s flag is to automatically add a sign-off to your commit message, which is our way to implement the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<license_and_DCO, Developer Certificate of Origin>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/community/index.adoc#license_and_DCO, Developer Certificate of Origin>>]
.

At any point during your work you can push your feature branch to the GitHub repository, to back your work up, let
others look at your work or contribute to the feature.

To do this, just run:
----
git push
----

[NOTE]
====
If it's your first push to this branch, Git will prompt you to define the remote branch to be associated with
your local branch with the following command:
----
git push --set-upstream origin FE-123
----
====

You can re-work, squash your commits and push as many times as you want on a feature branch.
Force pushes are allowed on feature branches.

=== Submitting a pull request to develop

Once you are satisfied with the state of your developments, you can submit it as a pull request.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before submitting your branch as a pull request, please squash/fix your commits to reduce the number of commits
and comment them accordingly. In the end, the division of changes into commits should make the PR easier to understand
and review.
====

You should also take a look at the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<review_checklist, review checklist>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/community/index.adoc#review_checklist, review checklist>>]
below to make sure your branch meets its criteria.

Open pull requests are then reviewed by the core maintainers to assign a reviewer to each of them.

To do so, go to the `branches` tab of the repository as described above.
Click the "New Pull Request" button for your branch.

Add a comment containing a short summary of the PR goal and any information that should go into the release notes.
It's especially important for PRs that have a direct impact on existing OperatorFabric deployments, to alert administrators
of the impacts of deploying a new version and help them with the migration.
Whenever possible/relevant, a link to the corresponding documentation is appreciated.

You need to
https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue[link your PR to the issue it is fixing]
so merging the PR will automatically close the corresponding issue. You can do so either manually or by adding
"Fix #XXX" to the PR's description.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that the base branch for the PR is `develop`, because feature branches are meant to be merged back into
`develop`. This should be the default value since `develop` is the default branch on this repository, but if not, select
it in the base branch dropdown list.
====


[[working_on_fix]]
=== Working on a fix for a previous version

To work on a fix for an existing version, the steps are similar to those described above, substituting `X.X.release` for
`develop`.

=== Reviewing a Pull Request

Only developers from the `reviewers` group can merge pull requests into `develop`, but this shouldn't
stop anyone interested in the topic of a PR to comment and review it.

[[review_checklist]]
==== Review checklist

* The PR comment contains the text to insert in release note. Otherwise, it should say why this development doesn't need to be on the release notes.
* If necessary, the PR should create or add content to a migration guide for the next version, under
`src/docs/asciidoc/resources`
* Check that GitHub Action build is passing for the PR
* The SonarCloud analysis should report no new bug or code smells, and should pass the quality gate
* Check that the base branch (i.e. the branch into which we want to merge changes) is correct: for feature branches pull requests, this branch should be `develop`.
* Look through changed files to make sure everything is relevant to the PR (no mistakenly added changes,
no secret information, no malicious changes) and to see if you have remarks on the way things are implemented
* Check that the commit(s) message(s) is(are) relevant and follow conventions
* If there is more than one commit, is it meaningful or do we need to squash ?
* Meaningful and sufficient unit tests for the backend
* Meaningful unit tests for the frontend (Angular tests can be complex to implement, we should focus on testing complex logic and not the framework itself)
* API testing via Karate has been updated
* Documentation has been updated (especially if configuration is needed)
* Migration guide has been updated if necessary 
* Configuration examples have been updated
* Build and run OpFab locally to see the new feature or bug fix at work. In the case of a new feature, it's also a way
of making sure that the configuration documentation is correct and easily understandable. 
* Check for error messages in the browser console.
* Check the UI in resolution 1680x1050 (minimum supported resolution for all features)
* Check the UI in smartphone resolution (only for feed, settings and notification filter features)
* Depending on the scope of the PR , build docker images and test in docker mode
* Check that the copyright header has been updated on the changed files if need be, and in the case of a first-time contributor, make sure they're added to the AUTHORS.txt file.
* Check new dependencies added to the project to see if they are compatible with the OperatorFabric license , see the following table

include::license_usage.adoc[leveloffset=+3]

==== Testing environment for reviewer

Compile and run OperatorFabric docker images is the most effective way to check any regression.

. Pull the submitted branch on a testing machine;
. Run a `docker compose` with the `${OF_HOME}/src/main/docker/test-environment/docker-compose.yml` file;
. Create `SNAPSHOT` docker images, from the `${OF_HOME}` directory with the following command: `./gradlew clean buildDocker`;
. Stop the `test-environment` docker compose;
. Go to `${OF_HOME}/config/docker`;
. Run the `./docker-compose.sh` script (or use the `docker-compose.yml` with a `docker compose` command);
. Go to `${OF_HOME}/src/test/resources/`;
. Run the following scripts: `./loadTestConf.sh &&  ./send6TestCards.sh`;
. Open the front-end in a browser and look for any regression.

To automate build and API testing, you can use `${OF_HOME}/src/test/api/karate/buildAndLaunchAll.sh`. 

=== Merging a Pull Request

Once the pull request meets all the criteria from the above check list, you can merge it into the `develop` branch.

. Go to the pull request page on GitHub
. Check that the base branch for the pull request is `develop` (or `X.X.release`). This information is visible at the
top of the page.
+
image::existing_PR_check_base.png[]

. If that is not the case, you can edit the base branch by clicking the `Edit` button in the top right corner.

. Click the `merge pull request` button at the bottom of the PR page

. Make sure that the corresponding GitHub issue was associated to the project for the current release. It should now be
visible under the "Done" column. If not, add it to the project and put it there manually.

. Go to the link:https://github.com/opfab/release-notes/[release-notes repository] and add the issue to the list with
the information provided in the PR comments.

=== Creating a release

See the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<release_process, release process>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/CICD/index.adoc#release_process, release process>>]
described in our CICD documentation for details.
