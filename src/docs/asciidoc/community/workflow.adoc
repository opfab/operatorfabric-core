= Contribution Workflow

The project started out using a
link:https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow[Feature Branch workflow], but
as the project team grew and we needed to manage support to previous releases we decided to switch to a workflow
based on the
link:{git_flow_post}[Git Flow workflow], starting after version 1.3.0.RELEASE.

The principles for this workflow were first described in the blog post linked above, and this document attempts to
summarize how we adapted it to our project. Statements in quotes are from the original blog post.

NOTE: In this document, *"repository version"* refers to the version defined in the VERSION file at the root of the
project, which is a parameter for certain build tasks and for our CICD pipeline.

== Principles

=== `develop` branch

The role of the `develop` branch is quite similar to that of the `master` branch in our previous "Feature Branch"
workflow.

The `develop` branch is where feature branches are branched off from, and where they're merged back to. This way,
the HEAD of the `develop` branch _"always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next
release"_.

The repository version on the `develop` branch should always be `SNAPSHOT`.

The daily CRON Travis job generating the documentation and docker images for the `SNAPSHOT` version are run from
this branch (see our
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<CICD, CICD documentation>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/CICD/index.adoc, CICD documentation>>]
for details).

=== `master` branch

_"When the source code in the develop branch reaches a stable point and is ready to be released, all the changes
should be merged back into master somehow and then tagged with a release number."_

This means that any commit on master is a production-ready release, be it a minor or a major version.

Any commit on `master` triggers a Travis build generating and pushing documentation and docker images for the
corresponding release version. As a version released from master is also by design the latest version, it will also
update the `latest` docker images and the `current` documentation folder on the website.

=== Hotfix branches

While minor and major versions are tagged in increasing and linear order on the `master` branch, it might be necessary
to create patches on previous releases.

To do so, we create hotfix branches branching off version commits on the `master` branch.

For example, the `1.8.hotfixes` branch branches off the commit tagged `1.8.0.RELEASE` on the `master` branch, and will
contain tags for `1.8.1.RELEASE`, `1.8.2.RELEASE` and so on.

*Naming convention:* Hotfix branches names should always start with the two digits representing the minor version
they're patching, followed by ".hotfixes".

.Examples of valid feature branch names:
* 1.8.hotfixes
* 2.0.hotfixes

=== Feature branches

Feature branches are used to develop new features or fix bugs described in JIRA issues.
They have two distinct use cases with similar workflows.

==== Feature branches for the next release

These feature branches are used to develop new features or fix bugs *for the next release*.

Their lifecycle is as follows:

. A new feature branch is branched off `develop` before starting work on a feature or bug.
. Once the developments are deemed ready by the developer(s) working on the feature, a pull request should be created
for this branch.
. New pull requests are discussed during daily meetings to assign someone from the Reviewers group to the issue.
. The pull request author and reviewer(s) then make use of the
link:https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests[Git Hub pull requests]
features (comments, proposed changes, etc.) to make changes to the PR until it meets the project requirements.
. Once it is ready to be included in the next version, the pull request is then merged back into `develop`.

==== Feature branches for hotfixes

These feature branches fix bugs in existing releases and give rise to new patches.

Their lifecycle is similar to regular feature branches, except they should be branched off (and merged back to) the
`X.X.hotfixes` branch corresponding to the release they are fixing.

Example: A feature branch working on bug 1234 affecting version 1.8.0.RELEASE should be branched off
branch `1.8.hotfixes`.

==== Common conventions

*Naming convention:* Feature branches names should always start with "FE-" followed by the reference of the GitHub issue
they're addressing, optionally followed by additional information if several branches are associated with a given issue.

.Examples of valid feature branch names:
* FE-123
* FE-123_Documentation
* FE-123_1

.Examples of invalid feature branch names:
* 123
* FE123
* SomeTextDescribingTheBranch

Commit messages should also start with the GitHub issue reference: `#123 My commit message`

This allows the branch, PR and commits to be directly accessible from the GitHub issue.

NOTE: The deprecated OC-XXX notation (from when we tracked issues in JIRA) is still accepted by the CI/CD pipeline
but won't be in the future.

=== Release branches

Once developments are in a release-ready state and have been tested on the `develop` branch, a release branch should
be created off `develop` to prepare the merge into master.

NOTE: _"All features that are targeted for the release-to-be-built must be merged in to develop at this point in time.
All features targeted at future releases may notâ€”they must wait until after the release branch is branched off."_

IMPORTANT: By contrast to what is described in the link:{git_flow_post}[original blog post], for now we have chosen to
only create the release branch once the developments are completely ready and tested on the develop branch, so that no
fixes should be made on the release branch. This simplifies things because it means that release branches don't have to
be merged back into `develop`.

Once the `X.X.X.release` branch has been created, a new commit should be made on this branch to change the repository
version from `SNAPSHOT` to `X.X.X.RELEASE`.
Then, pushing the branch will trigger a build and a "dry-run" generation of documentation and docker images. The aim
is to detect any issue with this generation before moving to master.

Finally, the `X.X.X.release` can be merged into `master`, triggering
The resulting merge commit on `master` should then be tagged with `X.X.X.RELEASE`.

All commits on `master` should be merged commits from `release` branches, direct pushes on master will be disabled in
the future.

*Naming convention:* The name of a release branch should match the repository version it is meant to merge into
`master` but in lower case to avoid confusion with release tags on master.

Example: The valid branch name for the branch bringing 1.3.0.RELEASE into `master` is 1.3.0.release

== Examples and commands

The aim of this section is to illustrate how our workflow works on a concrete example, complete with the required
`git` commands.

=== Initial state

In the initial state of our example, only `develop` and `master` exist.

The repository version in `master` is `1.3.0.RELEASE`, and the `develop` branch has just been branched off it. Commits
have been added to `develop` to change the repository version to `SNAPSHOT` and implement the changes necessary for
Git flow.

=== Starting work on a new feature for the next version

Let's say we want to start working on a feature described in GitHub issue #123.

----
git checkout develop <1>
git pull <2>
git checkout -b FE-123 <3>
----
<1> Check out the `develop` branch
<2> Make sure it is up to date with the remote (=GitHub repository)
<3> Create a `FE-123` off the `develop` branch

Then, you can start working on the feature and commit your work to the branch.

----
git commit -m "#123 Short message describing content of commit"
----

At any point during your work you can push your feature branch to the GitHub repository, to back your work up, let
others look at your work or contribute to the feature.

To do this, just run:
----
git push
----

[NOTE]
====
If it's your first push to this branch, Git will prompt you to define the remote branch to be associated with
your local branch with the following command:
----
git push --set-upstream origin FE-123
----
====

You can re-work, squash your commits and push as many times as you want on a feature branch.
Force pushes are allowed on feature branches.

To see your branch:

. Go to the https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core[operatorfabric-core repository on GitHub]
. Click the `branches` tab

[NOTE]
====
Feel free to add a copyright header (on top of the existing ones) to files you create or amend. See src/main/headers
for examples.
====

=== Submitting a pull request to develop

Once you are satisfied with the state of your developments, you can submit it as a pull request.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Before submitting your branch as a pull request, please squash/fix your commits so as to reduce the number of commits
and comment them accordingly. In the end, the division of changes into commits should make the PR easier to understand
and review.
====

You should also take a look at the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<review_checklist, review checklist>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/community/index.adoc#review_checklist, review checklist>>]
below to make sure your branch meets its criteria.

Once you feel your branch is ready, submit a pull request. Open pull requests are then reviewed by the core maintainers
to assign a reviewer to each of them.

To do so, go to the `branches` tab of the repository as described above.
Click the "New Pull Request" button for your branch.

Add a comment containing a short summary of the PR goal and any information that should go into the release notes.
It's especially important for PRs that have a direct impact on existing OperatorFabric deployments, to alert administrators
of the impacts of deploying a new version and help them with the migration.
Whenever possible/relevant, a link to the corresponding documentation is appreciated.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure that the base branch for the PR is `develop`, because feature branches are meant to be merged back into
`develop`. This should be the default value since `develop` is the default branch on this repository, but if not, select
it in the base branch dropdown list.
====

At this point, GitHub will tell you whether your branch could be automatically merged into `develop` or whether
there are conflicts to be fixed.

==== Case 1: GitHub is able to automatically merge your branch

This means that either your branch was up to date with develop or there were no conflicts.
In this case, just go ahead and fill in the PR title and message, then click "Create pull request".

==== Case 2: GitHub can't merge your branch automatically

This means that there are conflicts with the current state of the `develop` branch on GitHub.
To fix these conflicts, you need to update your local copy of the develop branch and merge it into your feature branch.

----
git checkout develop <1>
git pull <2>
git checkout FE-123 <3>
git merge develop <4>
----
<1> Check out the `develop` branch
<2> Make sure it is up to date with the remote (=GitHub repository)
<3> Check out the `FR-123` branch
<4> Merge the new commits from `develop` into the feature branch

Then, handle any conflicts from the merge. For example, let's say there is a conflict on file `dummy1.txt`:

----
Auto-merging dummy1.txt
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in dummy1.txt
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
----

Open file `dummy1.txt`:

.dummy1.txt
----
 <<<<<<< HEAD
 Some content from FE-123.
 =======
 Some content that has been changed on develop since FE-123 branched off.
 >>>>>>> develop
----

Update the content to reflect the changes that you want to keep:

.dummy1.txt
----
Some content from FE-123 and some content that has been changed on develop since FE-123 branched off.
----

----
git add dummy1.txt <1>
git commit <2>
git push <3>
----
<1> Add the manually merged file to the changes to be committed
<2> Commit the changes to finish the merge
<3> Push the changes to GitHub

Now, if you go back to GitHub and try to create a pull request again, GitHub should indicate that it is able to merge
automatically.

[[working_on_hotfix]]
=== Working on a fix for a previous version

To work on a fix for an existing version, the steps are similar to those described above, substituting `X.X.hotfix` for
`develop`.

=== Reviewing a Pull Request

Only developers from the `reviewers` group can merge pull requests into `develop`, but this shouldn't
stop anyone interested in the topic of a PR to comment and review it.

[[review_checklist]]
==== Review checklist

* The PR comment contains the text to insert in release note. Otherwise, it should say why this development doesn't need
to be on the release notes.
* Check that Travis build is passing (for both branch and PR)
* Check that the base branch (i.e. the branch into which we want to merge changes) is correct: for feature branches
pull requests, this branch should be `develop`.
* Look through changed files to make sure everything is relevant to the PR (no mistakenly added changes,
no secret information, no malicious changes) and to see if you have remarks on the way things are implemented
* Check that the commit(s) message(s) is(are) relevant and follow conventions (#XXX ... )
* If there is more than one commit, is it meaningful or do we need to squash ?
* Meaningful and sufficient unit tests for the backend (we aim for 80% coverage)
* Meaningful unit tests for the frontend (Angular tests can be complex to implement, we should focus on testing complex
logic and not the framework itself)
* Note: Because currently Sonar doesn't distinguish between back and front, the quality gate only enforces a 50% coverage
threshold.
* Check Sonar analysis on SonarCloud to see if Sonar reports any bugs or code smells on the new code
* API testing via Karate has been updated
* Documentation has been updated (especially if configuration is needed)
* Configuration examples have been updated (both for dev and docker)
* Build and run OpFab locally to see the new feature or bug fix at work. In the case of a new feature, it's also a way
of making sure that the configuration documentation is correct and easily understandable. 
* Check for error messages in the browser console.
* Depending on the scope of the PR , build docker images and test in docker mode
* Check that the copyright header has been updated on the changed files if need be, and in the case of a first-time
    contributor, make sure they're added to the AUTHORS.txt file.
* Check dependency added to the project to see if there are compliant with opfab licencing. 


==== Testing environment for reviewer

Compile and run OperatorFabric docker images is the most effective way to check any regression.

. Pull the submitted branch on a testing machine;
. Run a `docker-compose` with the `${OF_HOME}/src/main/docker/test-environment/docker-compose.yml` file;
. Create `SNAPSHOT` docker images, from the `${OF_HOME}` directory with the following command: `./gradlew clean dockerTagSNAPSHOT`;
. Stop the `test-environment` docker-compose;
. Go to `${OF_HOME}/config/docker`;
. Run the `./docker-compose.sh` script (or use the `docker-compose.yml` with a `docker-compose` command);
. Go to `${OF_HOME}/src/test/resources/`;
. Run the following scripts: `./loadTestConf.sh &&  ./send6TestCards.sh`;
. Open the front-end in a browser and look for any regression.

To automate build and API testing, you can use `${OF_HOME}/src/test/api/karate/buildAndLaunchAll.sh`. 

=== Merging a Pull Request

Once the pull request meets all the criteria from the above check list, you can merge it into the `develop` branch.

. Go to the pull request page on GitHub
. Check that the base branch for the pull request is `develop` (or `X.X.hotfixes`). This information is visible at the top of the page.
+
image::existing_PR_check_base.png[]

. If that is not the case, you can edit the base branch by clicking the `Edit` button in the top right corner.

. Click the `merge pull request` button at the bottom of the PR page

. Go to the https://opfab.atlassian.net[JIRA] page for the corresponding issue and
+
* Set the `Fix version` field to `Next Version` (or the corresponding `X.X.X.RELEASE` in the case of a hotfix)
* Set the `Status` field to `Done`

. Go to the link:https://github.com/opfab/release-notes/[release-notes repository] and add the issue to the list with
the information provided in the PR comments.


=== Creating a release or hotfix

See the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<release_process, release process>>]
