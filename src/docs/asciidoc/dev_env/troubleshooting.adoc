**Proxy error when running third-party docker-compose**
+++ </summary><div> +++

.Error message
[source]
----
Pulling rabbitmq (rabbitmq:3-management)...
ERROR: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: Proxy Authentication Required
----

.Possible causes & resolution
When running docker-compose files using third-party images(such as rabbitmq,
mongodb etc.) the first time, docker will need to pull these images from
their repositories.
If the docker proxy isn't set properly, you will see the above message.

To set the proxy, follow https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/[these
steps from the docker documentation].

If your proxy needs authentication, add your user and password as follows:
----
HTTP_PROXY=http://user:password@proxy.example.com:80/
----

IMPORTANT: The password should be URL-encoded.

**Java version not available when setting up environment**
+++ </summary><div> +++
When sourcing the link:https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/tree/master/bin/load_environment_light.sh[load_environment_light]
script to set up your environment, you might get the following error message:

.Error message
[source]
----
Stop! java 8.0.192-zulu is not available. Possible causes:
 * 8.0.192-zulu is an invalid version
 * java binaries are incompatible with Linux64
 * java has not been released yet
----

Select the next available version and update
link:https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/tree/master/bin/load_environment_light.sh[load_environment_light] accordingly before
sourcing it again.

.Possible causes & resolution
The java version currently listed in the script might have been deprecated
(for security reasons) or might not be available for your operating system
(for example, 8.0.192-zulu wasn't available for Ubuntu).

Run `sdk list java` to find out which versions are available. You will get
this kind of output:
