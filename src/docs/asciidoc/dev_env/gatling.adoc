# Load testing with Gatling

Load tests using Gatling are written in java.
All test java sources are in src/test/gatling/src/java


IMPORTANT: If your OperatorFabric instance is not running on localhost, you need to edit the tests classes  and replace localhost with the address of your running instance.


## Run a test

To launch a specific test, launch:

....
$OF_HOME/gradlew clean  gatlingRun-<TestClassName>
....

The result will be available in the `src/test/gatling/build/reports/gatling/` folder.
