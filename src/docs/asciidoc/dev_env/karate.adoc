# API testing with Karate DSL 

IMPORTANT: If your OperatorFabric instance is not running on localhost, you need to replace localhost with the address
of your running instance within the `karate-config.js` file.

All the scripts and test files are in src/test/api/karate. 

## Run a feature

To launch a specific test, launch in src/test/api/karate.

....
$OF_HOME/gradlew karate --args=myfeature.feature
....

The result will be available in the `target` repository.

## Non regression tests

You can launch operatorFabric non-regression tests via the script launchAll.sh in src/test/api/karate. 

To have the test passed, you need to have a clean Mongo DB database. To do that, you can use the scripts : 

* src/test/resources/deleteAllCards.sh
* src/test/resources/deleteAllArchivedCards.sh
