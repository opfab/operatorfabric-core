= Kafka Implementation

Next to publishing cards to OperatorFabric using the REST API, OperatorFabric also supports publishing cards via a Kafka Topic.
In the default configuration Kafka is disabled.

== Setup Kafka enviroment
If you do not have a Kafka environment running you need to set one up so the Kafka consumers and producers can find each other.
You can for example download link:{lense}[lenses.io] for an easy-to-use broker with a graphical interface. Another option is to add
a free broker like a bitnami Kafka image to docker compose. To do so, add the following lines to `config/dev/docker-compose.yml` or
`config/docker/docker-compose.yml` for the zookeeper and bitnami images:
[source,yaml]
----
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: bitnami/zookeeper:3
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
    environment:
      ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN: "yes"
  kafka:
    image: bitnami/kafka:2
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: "1"
      KAFKA_LISTENERS: "PLAINTEXT://:9092"
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: "PLAINTEXT://172.17.0.1:9092"
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: "zookeeper:2181"
      ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER: "yes"
  rabbitmq:

== Enabling Kafka

To enable Kafka support you need to set the `kafka.consumer.group_id property` in the `cards-publication.yml` file:
[source,yaml]
----
  spring:
    kafka:
      consumer:
        group-id: opfab-command
----

The default topic from which the messages are consumed is called `opfab`. This setting can be modified by setting `opfab.kafka.card.topics.topicname`.
The default topic to which messages are produced is called `opfab-response`. This setting can be modified by setting the `opfab.kafka.topics.response-card`, see below.

The default Kafka Avro serializers and deserializers need a registry service. Make sure the registry service setting is provided in
the `card-publication.yml` file. When you use the provided `KafkaAvroWithoutRegistrySerializer` and
`KafkaAvroWithoutRegistryDeserializer` no schema registry setting is needed.

With the default settings, the Kafka consumer expects a broker running on http//127.0.0.1:9092 and a schema registry on http://127.0.0.1:8081.

Example settings for the cards-publication.yml file:
[source,yaml]
----
opfab:
  kafka:
    topics:
      card:
        topicname: opfab
      response-card:
        topicname: opfab-response
    schema:
      registry:
        url: http://localhost:8081

----

<<Cards-publication service>> for more settings.

See link:{kafka_schema}[Schema management] for detailed information on using and benefits of a schema registry.

== OperatorFabric Kafka source code
== Listener / deserializer
Most of the OperatorFabric Kafka implementation can be found at

`org.opfab.cards.publication.kafka`:: for
the implementation of the deserializers and mapping of Kafka topics to OperatorFabric cards and
`org.opfab.autoconfigure.kafka` ::
for the various Kafka configuration options.

=== Kafka OperatorFabric AVRO schema
The AVRO schema, the byte format in which messages are transferred using Kafka topics, can be found at `client/src/main/avro`.
Message are wrapped in a CardCommand object before being sent to a Kafka topic. The CardCommand consists of some additional information and the
OperatorFabric card itself, see also <<card_structure>>. The additional information, for example CommandType, consists mostly of the information
present in a REST operation but not in Kafka. For example the http method (POST, DELETE, UPDATE) used.

== Configure Kafka
=== Setting a new deserializer
By default, OperatorFabric uses the  `io.confluent.kafka.serializers.KafkaAvroDeserializer` from link:{confluent}[Confluent]. However, you can write your own
deserializer. To use your own deserializer, make sure
`spring.deserializer.value.delegate.class` points to your deserializer.

=== Configuring a broker
When you have a broker running on localhost port 9092, you do not need to set the bootstrap severs. If this is not the case, you need tell
Operator Fabric where the broker can be found. You can do so by setting the bootstrap-servers property in the `cards-publication.yml` file:
[source, yaml]
----
spring:
  kafka:
    bootstrap-servers: 172.17.0.1:9092
----

== Kafka card producer
To send a CardCommand to OperatorFabric, start by implementing a simple Kafka producer by following for example link:{spring_kafka_doc}[Spring for Apache Kafka].
Note that some properties of CardCommand or its embedded Card are required. If not set, the card will be rejected by OperatorFabric.

When you dump the card (which is about to be put on a topic) to stdout, you should see something like the line below. Do ignore the actual values from the dump below.

[source, json]
----
{
  "command": "CREATE_CARD",
  "process": "integrationTest",
  "processInstanceId": "fa6ce61f-192f-11eb-a6e3-eea952defe56",

    ],
    "groupRecipients": null,
    "externalRecipients": null,
    "entitiesAllowedToRespond": [
      "ENTITY1"
    ],
    "entityRecipients": null,
    "hasBeenAcknowledged": null,
    "data": "{\"action\":\"Just do something\"}"
  }
}

----

== Response Cards
OperatorFabric <<response_cards>> can be sent by REST of put on a Kafka topic. The Kafka response card configuration follows the
convention to configure a REST endpoint. Instead of setting the 'http://host/api' URL, you set it to 'kafka:response-topic' in the `externalRecipients-url:`
section from the cards-publication.yml file:

[source, yaml]
----
externalRecipients-url: "{\
           processAction: \"http://localhost:8090/test\", \
           mykafka: \"kafka:topicname\"
           }"
----

Note that `topicname` is a placeholder for now. All response cards are returned via the same Kafka response topic, as specified in the `opfab.kafka.topics.response-card` field.
