bin/build_all.sh:: builds all artifacts as gradle is not able to manage
inter project dependencies
bin/clean_all.sh:: remove IDE data (project configuration, build output
directory) - idea, vsc
bin/load_environment_light.sh:: sets up environment when *sourced* (java
version, gradle version, maven version, node version)

subdirectories to a ramdisk when *sourced* at ~/tmp
bin/run_all.sh:: runs all all services (see below)

There are prerequisites before sourcing load_environment_ramdisk.sh:

* Logged user needs sudo rights for mount
* System needs to have enough free ram

CAUTION: Never ever run a `gradle clean` or `./gradlew clean` to avoid deleting those links.

== run_all.sh

Please see `run_all.sh -h` usage before running.
