= Node services 

When developing Node services, you have the option to run the service outside of the Docker environment. To do this, follow these steps:

Stop the Docker container running the Node service. For example:

```
    docker stop cards-reminder
```

After stopping the Docker container, you can start the service in development mode with hot reload : 

```
    cd node-services/cards-reminder
    npm run start:dev        

```

== Other useful commands 

Here are some other useful commands for working with Node services:

To launch unit tests : 
```
    npm run test 
```

To build the service : 

```
    npm run build
```

To start the service without hot reload : 

```
    node build/cardReminder.ts
```
