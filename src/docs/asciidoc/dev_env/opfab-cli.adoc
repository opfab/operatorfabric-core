[[CLI]]
= OperatorFabric CLI (Command Line Interface)

The OperatorFabric CLI provides a convenient way to interact with OperatorFabric during development, eliminating the need for direct API access.

The CLI is automatically installed when you execute the `bin/load_environment_light.sh` script.

To use the CLI, simply type `opfab help` in your terminal to view a list of available commands.

Before you can start using the CLI, you must first authenticate yourself with the desired OperatorFabric instance using the login command.
