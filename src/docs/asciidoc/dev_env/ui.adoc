= User Interface

The https://github.com/angular/angular-cli[Angular CLI] version 6.0.8 has been used to generate this project.

IMPORTANT: In the following document the variable declared as `OF_HOME` is the root folder of the `operatorfabric-core project`.

[horizontal]
CLI:: stands for *Command Line Interface*
SPA:: stands for *Single Page Application*

== Run

=== Front End development

OperatorFabric uses 4 external services to run properly :
 
 * an event queue: RabbitMQ;
 * a no SQL database: MongoDB;
 * an authentication provider: Keycloak;
 * a web server: Nginx.

Those instances are available as docker images in the project.
se `docker-compose` and the `${OF_HOME}/config/dev/docker-compose.yml` to run them.
After launching docker containers, use the following command line `$OF_HOME/bin/run_all.sh start` to run the application.

Once the whole application is ready, you should have the following output in your terminal:

[source, shell]

----

Wait a moment before trying to connect to the`SPA`, leaving time for the OperatorFabricServices to boot up completely.

The `SPA`, on a local machine, is available at the following Url: `http://localhost:2002/`.

To log in you need to use a valid user among the following: `operator1`, `operator3` or `admin`.
The common password is `test` for them all.

To test the reception of cards, you can use the following script to create dummy cards:

[source,shell]
----
${OF_HOME}/services/core/cards-publication/src/main/bin/push_cards_loop.sh
----

For more realistic card sending use, once Karate env correctly configured, the Karate scripts called :

** `${OF_HOME}/src/test/resources/loadTestConf.sh`
** `${OF_HOME}/src/test/resources/send6TestCards.sh`

Once logged in, after one of those scripts have been running, you should be able to see some cards displayed in `http://localhost:2002/`.


== Build

Within the folder `${OF_HOME}/ui/main`, run `ng build` to build the project.

The build artifacts will be stored in:

[source,shell]
----
${OF_HOME}/ui/main/build/distribution
----

The previous command could lead to the following error:
[source, shell]
----
Generating ES5 bundles for differential loading...
An unhandled exception occurred: Call retries were exceeded
See "/tmp/ng-<random-string>/angular-errors.log" for further details.
----

where `ng-<random-string>` is a temporary folder created by Angular to build the front-end.

Use `node --max_old_space_size=4096 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build` instead to solve this problem.

== Test

=== Standalone tests

Run in the `${OF_HOME}/ui/main` directory the command `ng test --watch=false` to execute the unit tests
on https://jasmine.github.io[Jasmine] using https://karma-runner.github.io[Karma] to drive the browser.

=== Test during UI development

. if the RabbitMQ, MongoDB and Keycloak docker containers are not running, launch them;
. set your environment variables with `source ${OF_HOME}/bin/load_environment_light.sh`;
. run the micro services using the same command as earlier: `${OF_HOME}/bin/run_all.sh start`;
. if needed, enable a card-operation test flow using the script `${OF_HOME}/service/core/cards-publication/src/main/bin/push_cards_loop.sh`;
. launch an angular server with the command: `ng serve`;
. test your changes in your browser using this url: `http://localhost:4200` which leads to `http://localhost:4200/#/feed`.

NOTE: If `ng serve` returns the error `Command 'ng' not found`, install the Angular CLI globally with the following
command.
+
`npm install -g @angular/cli`
+
This will install the latest version of the Angular command line, which might not be in line with the one used by the
project, but it's not an issue as when you run `ng serve` the local version of the Angular CLI
(as defined in the package.json file) will be used.
