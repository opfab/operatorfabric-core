[[setup_dev_env]]
= Setting up your development environment

WARNING: The steps below assume that you have installed and are using
https://sdkman.io/[sdkman] and
https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm] to manage tool versions ( for java,
gradle, node and npm).

There are several ways to get started with OperatorFabric. Please look into
the section that best fits your needs.

TIP: If you encounter any issue, see
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<troubleshooting, Troubleshooting>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/dev_env/index.adoc#troubleshooting, Troubleshooting>>]
below. In particular,
a command that hangs then fails is often a proxy issue.

The following steps describe how to launch MongoDB, RabbitMQ and SonarQube
using Docker,  build OperatorFabric using gradle and run it using the
`run_all.sh` script.

== Clone repository
----
git clone https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core.git
cd operatorfabric-core
----

== Set up your environment (environment variables & appropriate versions of gradle, maven, etcâ€¦)
----
source bin/load_environment_light.sh
----

TIP: From now on, you can use environment variable $OF_HOME to go back to
the home repository of OperatorFabric.

== Deploy dockerized MongoDB, RabbitMQ and SonarQube
MongoDB, RabbitMQ and SonarQube are needed for the tests to be run so the
build can be done.

A docker-compose file with properly configured containers is available
link:https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/tree/master/src/main/docker/test-quality-environment/[there].

The `docker-compose` can be run in detached mode:
----
cd src/main/docker/test-quality-environment/
docker-compose up -d
----

== Build OperatorFabric with Gradle

Using the wrapper in order to ensure building the project the same way from one machine to another.

To only compile and package the jars:
----
cd $OF_HOME
./gradlew assemble
----

To launch the Unit Test, compile and package the jars:
----
cd $OF_HOME
./gradlew build
----

== Run OperatorFabric Services using the `run_all.sh` script
----
bin/run_all.sh start
----

TIP: See `bin/run_all.sh -h` for details.

== Check services status
----
bin/run_all.sh status
----

== Log into the UI

URL: localhost:2002/ui/

login: admin

password: test

WARNING: It might take a little while for the UI to load even after all
services are running.

WARNING: Don't forget the *final slash* in the URL or you will get an error.

== Push cards to the feed

You can check that you see cards into the feed by running the
`push_card_loop.sh` script.
----
services/core/cards-publication/src/main/bin/push_card_loop.sh
