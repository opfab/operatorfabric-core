This section describes the projects requirements regardless of
installation options.
Please see
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<setup_dev_env, Setting up your environment>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/dev_env/index.adoc#setup_dev_env, Setting up your environment>>] below for details on:

* setting up a development environment with these prerequisites
* building and running OperatorFabric

== Tools and libraries

* Gradle 6 +
* Java 8.0 +
* Maven 3.5.3 +
* Docker
* Docker Compose with 2.1+ file format support
* Chrome (needed for UI tests in build)

NOTE: the current Jdk used for the project is Java 8.0.242-zulu.

IMPORTANT: It is highly recommended to use https://sdkman.io/[sdkman] and
https://github.com/creationix/nvm[nvm] to manage tools versions.

Once you have installed sdkman and nvm, you can **source** the following
script to set up your development environment (appropriate versions of Gradle,
Java, Maven and project variables set):
