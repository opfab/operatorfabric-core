= External Devices Service

The external devices service is an optional service allowing OperatorFabric to relay notifications to external
physical devices.

== Specification

The aim of this section is to describe the initial business need that led to the creation of this service and what use
cases are currently supported.

OperatorFabric users already have the option to be notified of a card's arrival by a sound played by their browser.
There is a different sound for each severity, and they are configurable for a given instance. The users can decide to
opt out of sound notifications for certain severities.
We also added an option for the sounds to be repeated until the operator interacted with the application (i.e. clicked
anywhere on the page) so as to make them harder to miss.

This can be enough for some use cases, but it was not ideal for operators working in control rooms. Indeed, control
rooms each have an external sound system that is shared for the whole room, and existing applications currently
trigger sound alerts on these sound systems rather than on each operator's computer.

This has several advantages:

* The sound can be heard by all operators
* It can be heard even if the operator is not at their desk
* The sound system can warn that the connexion with an application has been lost if it hasn't received a "watchdog"
signal for a given period of time.

As a result, external devices support in OperatorFabric aims to allow sound notifications to be passed on to external
sound systems. The sound system on which the sound will be played can depend on the user receiving the notification.
For example, all operators working in control room A will have their sounds played on the control room's central sound
system, while operators from control room B will use theirs.
Only one external device can be configured for each user.

So far, only sound systems using the Modbus protocol are supported, but we would like to be able to support other
protocols (and ultimately allow people to supply their own drivers) in the future.

== Implementation

=== Architecture

Given the use case described above, a new service was necessary to act as a link between the OperatorFabric UI and
the external devices. This service is in charge of:

* Managing the configuration relative to external devices (see below for details)
* Process requests from the UI (e.g. "play the sound for ALARM for user operator1_fr") and translate them as requests to
the appropriate device in their supported protocol, based on the above configuration
* Allow the pool of devices to be managed (connection, disconnection)

This translates as three APIs.

Here is what happens when user operator1_fr receives a card with severity ALARM:

. In the Angular code, the reception of the card triggers a sound notification.
. If the external devices feature is enabled and the user has chosen to play sounds on external devices
(instead of the browser), the UI code sends a POST request on the `external-devices/notifications` endpoint on the
NGINX gateway, with the following payload:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "opfabSignalId": "ALARM"
}
----
+
. The NGINX server, acting as a gateway, forwards it to the `/notifications` endpoint on the External Devices service.
. The External Devices service queries the configuration repositories to find out which external device is configured
for operator1_fr, how to connect to it and what signal "ALARM" translates to on this particular device.
. It then creates the appropriate connection if it doesn't exist yet, and sends the signal.

=== Configuration

The following elements need to be configurable:

. For each user, which device to use:
+
.userConfiguration
[source,json,]
----
{
  "userLogin": "operator1_fr",
  "externalDeviceId": "CDS_1"
}
----
+
. How to connect to a given external device (host, port)
+
.deviceConfiguration
[source,json,]
----
{
  "id": "CDS_1",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 4300,
  "signalMappingId": "default_CDS_mapping"
}
----
+
. How to map an OperatorFabric signal key footnote:[currently, that means a severity, but in the future it could also
be a process id, or anything identifying the signal to be played] to a signal (sound, light) on the external system
+
.signalMapping
[source,json,]
----
{
  "id": "default_CDS_mapping",
  "supportedSignals": {
    "ALARM": 1,
    "ACTION": 2,
    "COMPLIANT": 3,
    "INFORMATION": 4
  }
}
----

This means that a single physical device allowing 2 different sets of sounds to be played (for example one set for desk
A and another set for desk B) would be represented as two different device configurations, with different ids.

.Device configurations
[source,json,]
----
[{
  "id": "CDS_A",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 4300,
  "signalMappingId": "mapping_A"
},
{
  "id": "CDS_B",
  "host": "localhost",
  "port": 4300,
  "signalMappingId": "mapping_B"
}]
----

.Signal mappings
[source,json,]
----
[{
  "id": "mapping_A",
  "supportedSignals": {
    "ALARM": 1,
    "ACTION": 2,
    "COMPLIANT": 3,
    "INFORMATION": 4
  }
},
{
  "id": "mapping_B",
  "supportedSignals": {
    "ALARM": 5,
    "ACTION": 6,
    "COMPLIANT": 7,
    "INFORMATION": 8
  }
}]
----

NOTE: The signalMapping object is built as a Map with String keys (rather than the Severity enum or any otherwise
constrained type) because there is a strong possibility that in the future we might want to map something other than
severities.

Please see the https://opfab.github.io/documentation/current/api/external-devices/[API documentation] for details.

NOTE: There is a `Device` object distinct from `DeviceConfiguration` because the latter represents static information
about how to reach a device, while the former contains information about the actual connexion and its status.
For example, this is why the device configuration contains a `host` (which can be a hostname) while the device
has a `resolvedAddress`.
As a result, they are managed through separate endpoints, which might also make things easier if we need to secure
them differently (some people might be allowed to connect/disconnect devices but not change their configuration).

== Configuration

== Connexion Management

OperatorFabric doesn't automatically attempt to connect to configured external devices on start up as they might not
be available when the OperatorFabric instance starts. Similarly, posting a new device configuration to the external
devices service doesn't cause it to attempt to connect immediately, as the configuration setup might be done in advance
of the actual activation.

However, if a notification is received by the external devices service that needs to be passed on to a device that is
configured but not connected yet, the connection will be performed automatically.

== Configuration Management

In coherence with the way Entities, Perimeters, Users and Groups are managed, SignalMapping, UserConfiguration and
DeviceConfiguration resources can be deleted even if other resources link to them.
For example, if a device configuration lists `someMapping` as its `signalMappingId` and a DELETE request is sent
on `someMapping`, the deletion will be performed and return a 200 Success, and the device will have a `null`
`signalMappingId`.

== Drivers

This section contains information that is specific to each type of driver. Currently, the only supported driver uses
the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus[Modbus protocol].

=== Modbus Driver

The Modbus driver is based on the https://github.com/kochedykov/jlibmodbus[jlibmodbus] library to create a
`ModbusMaster` for each device and then send requests through it using the
https://github.com/kochedykov/jlibmodbus/blob/master/src/com/intelligt/modbus/jlibmodbus/msg/request/WriteSingleRegisterRequest.java[WriteSingleRegisterRequest]
object.

We are currently using the "BROADCAST" mode, which (at least in the jlibmodbus implementation) means that the Modbus
master doesn't expect any response to its requests (which makes sense because if there really are several clients
responding to the broadcast, )
This is mitigated by the fact that if watchdog signals are enabled, the external devices will be able to detect that
they are not receiving signals correctly.
In the future, it could be interesting to switch to the TCP default so OperatorFabric can be informed of any exception
in the processing of the request, allowing for example to give a more meaningful connection status
(see https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/issues/2294[#2294])

=== Adding new drivers

New drivers should implement the `ExternalDeviceDriver` interface, and a corresponding factory implementing the
`ExternalDeviceDriverFactory` interface should be created with it.

The idea is that in the future, using dependency injection, Spring should be able to pick up any factory on the classpath implementing
the correct interface.

NOTE: `ExternalDeviceDriver`, `ExternalDeviceDriverFactory` and the accompanying custom exceptions should be made
available as a jar on Maven Central if we want to allow project users to provide their own drivers.

NOTE: If several drivers need to be used on a given OperatorFabric instance at the same time, we will need to introduce
a device type in the deviceConfiguration object.
