[[users_management]]
= User management 

The User service manages users, groups, entities and perimeters (linked to groups).

Users:: represent account information for a person destined to receive cards in the OperatorFabric instance.
Entities::
- represent set of users destined to receive collectively some cards.
- can be used to model organizations, for examples : control center, company , department... 
- can be used in a way to handle rights on card reception in OperatorFabric.
- can be part of another entity (or even several entities). This relationship is modeled using the "parent entity" property
Groups::
- represent set of users destined to receive collectively some cards.
- has a set of perimeters to define rights for card reception in OperatorFabric (group type 'PERMISSION').
- can be used to model roles in organizations (group type 'ROLE'), for examples : supervisor, dispatcher ... 

WARNING: The user define here is an internal representation of the individual card recipient in `OperatorFabric` the authentication is leave to specific OAuth2 external service.

NOTE: In the following commands the `$token` is an authentication token currently valid for the `OAuth2` service used by the current `OperatorFabric` system.


== Users, groups, entities and perimeters

User service manages users, groups, entities and perimeters.

=== Users

Users are the individuals and mainly physical person who can log in OperatorFabric.

The access to this service has to be authorized, in the `OAuth2` service used by the current `OperatorFabric` instance, at least to access User information and to manage Users. The membership of groups and entities are stored in the user information.

NOTE: User login must be lowercase. Otherwise, it will be converted to lowercase before saving to the database.

WARNING: Resource identifiers such as login, group id, entity id and perimeter id must only contain the following characters: letters, _, - or digits.

NOTE: By default, a user cannot have several sessions at the same time. If you want to enable it, set checkIfUserIsAlreadyConnected to false in the configuration file of the card consultation service ( cards-consultation-XXX.yml ). However, this is not recommended as it may cause synchronization problems between the sessions using the same login


==== Automated user creation

In case of a user does exist in a provided authentication service but he does not exist in the `OperatorFabric`
instance, when he is authenticated and connected for the first time in the `OperatorFabric` instance, the user is
automatically created in the system without attached group or entity.
The administration of the groups, entities and perimeters is dealt by the administrator manually.
More details about automated user creation
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<opfab_spec_conf, here>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/deployment/index.adoc#opfab_spec_conf, here>>]

=== Entities
The notion of entity is loose and can be used to model organizations structures(examples : control center, company , department... ).
Entities are used to send cards to several users without a name specifically. The information about membership to an
entity is stored in the user's data (`entities` field of the `user` object). In Entity objects, the `parents` property (array) expresses the fact that this entity is a part of one or several other entities. This feature allows cards to be sent to a group of entities without having to repeat the detailed list of entities for each card.
The boolean property `entityAllowedToSendCard` (default value `true`) can be used to mark an Entity as not eligible as card publisher. This can be useful for a group of entities where only child entities should be used as card publishers while the parent is just a logical group usable as card recipient. The `labels` property (array) allows to associate string labels to an Entity object.

Examples using entities can be found 
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<_send_to_several_users, here>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#_send_to_several_users, here>>]
.

=== Permissions
Permissions in `OperatorFabric` are used to configure user's permission on the UI and control the access to the APIs.
The information about permissions is stored in the data of the user's groups (`Permissions` field of the `group` object).
The available permissions are:

 - `ADMIN`: Administrator permission
 - `ADMIN_BUSINESS_PROCESS`: Permission to administer process bundles (add, update, delete bundles)
 - `VIEW_ALL_ARCHIVED_CARDS`: Permission to access all archived cards
 - `READONLY`: Readonly permission. User cannot send user cards, cannot respond to a card, when acknowledges a card he does not acknowledge it for his entities.


=== Groups
The notion of group is loose and can be used to simulate business role in `OperatorFabric` (examples : supervisor, dispatcher ... ) by setting group type to 'ROLE' or to define permissions on processes/states by setting the group type to 'PERMISSION'.
Groups are used to send cards to several users without a name specifically. The information about membership to a
group is stored in the user information. A group contains a list of perimeters which define the rights of reception/writing for a couple process/state. The rules used to send cards are described in the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<reception_rules, recipients section>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#reception_rules, recipients section>>]
.
.

=== Perimeters
Perimeters are used to define rights for reading/writing cards. A perimeter is composed of an identifier (unique), a process name and a list of state/rights couple.
Possible rights for receiving/writing cards are :

- Receive : the rights for receiving a card
- Write : the rights for writing a card, that is to say respond to a card or create a new card
- ReceiveAndWrite : the rights for receiving and writing a card

=== Alternative way to manage groups and entities

The standard way to handle groups and entities in `OperatorFabric` instance is dealt on the user information.
There is an alternative way to manage groups and entities through the authentication token, the groups and entities are defined by the administrator of the authentication service.
See
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<jwt_mode, here>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/deployment/index.adoc#jwt_mode, here>>]
for more details to use this feature.

== Currently connected users

The endPoint `/cards/connections` gives the list of connected users in real time. It is accessible by all users.

== Real time users

OperatorFabric allows you to see which entities/groups are logged in and not logged in. To have this information, you must upload a configuration file, using the endpoint /businessconfig/realtimescreens, via a POST request. In this file, you can configure several screens, each one containing the list of entities/groups you want to see.

This interface is accessible via the user menu (top right of the screen).

Here is an example of the configuration file :

With this configuration file, 4 different screens will be available : "All Control Centers", "French Control Centers", "Italian Control Centers" and "Dutch Control Centers".

For example, in the UI, "All Control Centers" will look like :

image::realtimescreens_screenshot.png[Real Time Screens screenshot,align="center"]

== Activity area

OperatorFabric allows you to connect/disconnect to/from one or several entity/ies. By default, the user is connected to
all the entities to which he belongs.
By choosing to disconnect from an entity, the user will still be a member of this entity, but he will no longer have
access to the cards intended for this entity, until he reconnects to it.

If set visible in ui-menu.json, this interface is accessible via the user menu (top right of the screen).

The choice of activity area may be done during user logging phase if you set selectActivityAreaOnLogin to true in web-ui.json.

If the user is a member of one (or more) real-time group(s), then he will see on the screen the members of these groups, currently connected.

== User actions logs

OperatorFabric allows you to view most relevant user actions:

- OPEN_SUBSCRIPTION 
- CLOSE_SUBSCRIPTION 
- ACK_CARD
- UNACK_CARD
- READ_CARD
- UNREAD_CARD
- SEND_CARD
- SEND_RESPONSE

For each action the following information are available: 

- `date`: date and time of the action 
- `action`: type of action 
- `login`: username of te user who performed the action
- `entities`: list of user entities
- `cardUid`: card Uid
- `comment`: textual information


If set visible in ui-menu.json and user is admin, this interface is accessible via the user menu (top right of the screen).
