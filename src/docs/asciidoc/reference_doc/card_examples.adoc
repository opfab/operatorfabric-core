= Cards Examples

Before detailing the content of cards, let's show you what cards look like through few examples of json.

[[minimal_card]]
== Minimal Card

The OperatorFabric Card specification defines mandatory attributes, but some optional attributes are needed for cards to be useful in OperatorFabric. Let's clarify those point through few examples of minimal cards and what happens when they're used as if.

=== Send to One User
The following card contains only the mandatory attributes.

....
{
	"publisher":"TSO1",
	"processVersion":"0.1",
	"process":"process",
	"processInstanceId":"process-000",
	"startDate":1546297200000,
	"severity":"INFORMATION",
	"title":{"key":"card.title.key"},
	"summary":{"key":"card.summary.key"},
	"recipient":{
		"type":"USER",
		"identity":"tso1-operator"
	}

}
....

This an information about the process instance `process-000` of process `process`, sent by `TSO1`. The title and the summary refer to `i18n` keys
defined in the associated `i18n` files of the process. This card is displayable since the first january 2019 and
should only be received by the user using the `tso1-operator` login.

=== Send to several users

==== Simple case (sending to a group)

The following example is nearly the same as the previous one except for the recipient.

....
{
	"publisher":"TSO1",
	"processVersion":"0.1",
	"process":"process",
	"processInstanceId":"process-000",
	"startDate":1546297200000,
	"severity":"INFORMATION",
	"title":{"key":"card.title.key"},
	"summary":{"key":"card.summary.key"},
	"recipient":{
		"type":"GROUP",
		"identity":"TSO1"
	}
}
....

Here, the recipient is a group, the `TSO1`. So all users who are members of this group will receive the card.



==== Simple case (sending to a group and an entity)

The following example is nearly the same as the previous one except for the recipient.

....
{
	"publisher":"TSO1",
	"processVersion":"0.1",
	"process":"process",
	"processInstanceId":"process-000",
	"startDate":1546297200000,
	"severity":"INFORMATION",
	"title":{"key":"card.title.key"},
	"summary":{"key":"card.summary.key"},
	"recipient":{
		"type":"GROUP",
        "identity":"TSO1"
	},
	"entityRecipients" : ["ENTITY1"]
}
....

Here, the recipients are a group and an entity, the `TSO1` group and `ENTITY1` entity. So all users who are both members
of this group and this entity will receive the card.

==== Simple case (sending to an entity)

The following example is nearly the same as the previous one except for the recipient.

....
{
	"publisher":"TSO1",
	"processVersion":"0.1",
	"process":"process",
	"processInstanceId":"process-000",
	"startDate":1546297200000,
	"severity":"INFORMATION",
	"title":{"key":"card.title.key"},
	"summary":{"key":"card.summary.key"},
	"entityRecipients" : ["ENTITY1"]
}
....

Here, the recipient is an entity and there is no more groups. So all users who has the right perimeter and who are members of this entity will receive the card. More information on perimeter can be found in 
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<users_service,user documentation>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#users_service, user documentation>>]


==== Complex case

If this card need to be viewed by a user who is not in the `TSO1` group, it's possible to tune more precisely the
definition of the recipient. If the `tso2-operator` needs to see also this card, the recipient definition could be(the following code details only the recipient part):

....
"recipient":{ 
	"type":"UNION",
	"recipients":[
		{ "type": "GROUP", "identity":"TSO1"},
		{ "type": "USER", "identity":"tso2-operator"}
		]
	}
....

So here, all the users of the `TSO1` group will receive the `INFORMATION` as should the `tos2-operator` user.

== Regular Card

The previous cards were nearly empty regarding information carrying. In fact, cards are intended to contain more information than a title and a summary. The optional attribute `data` is here for that. This attribute is destined to contain any `json` object. The creator of the card is free to put any information needed as long as it's in a `json` format.

=== Full of Hidden data

For this example we will use our previous example for the `TSO1` group with a `data` attribute containing the definition of a `json` object containing two attributes: `stringExample` and `numberExample`.

....
{
	"publisher":"TSO1",
	"processVersion":"0.1",
	"process":"process",
	"processInstanceId":"process-000",
	"startDate":1546297200000,
	"severity":"INFORMATION",
	"title":{"key":"card.title.key"},
	"summary":{"key":"card.summary.key"},
	"recipient":{
		"type":"USER",
		"identity":"tso1-operator"
	},
	"data":{
		"stringExample":"This is a not so random string of characters.",
		"numberExample":123
		}

}
....

This card contains some data but when selected in the feed nothing more than the previous example of card happen because
there is no rendering configuration.

=== Fully useful

When a card is selected in the feed (of the GUI), the data is displayed in the detail panel.
The way details are formatted depends on the template contained in the bundle associated with the process as
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<bundle_technical_overview, described here>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#bundle_technical_overview, described here>>]
. To have an effective example without to many actions to performed, the following example will use an already existing
configuration.The one presents in the development version of OperatorFabric, for test purpose(`TEST` bundle).

At the card level, the attributes in the card telling OperatorFabric which template to use is the `details` attributes.

....
{
	"publisher":"TEST_PUBLISHER",
	"processVersion":"1",
	"process":"TEST",
	"processInstanceId":"process-000",
	"startDate":1546297200000,
	"severity":"INFORMATION",
	"title":{"key":"process.title"},
	"summary":{"key":"process.summary"},
	"recipient":{
		"type":"USER",
		"identity":"tso1-operator"
	},
	"data":{"rootProp":"Data displayed in the detail panel"},
	"details":[{"title":{"key":"process.detail.tab.first"}, "templateName":"template1"}]

}
....

So here a single custom data is defined and it's `rootProp`. This attribute is used by the template called by the
`details` attribute. This attribute contains an array of `json` object containing an `i18n` key and a `template`
reference. Each of those object is a tab in the detail panel of the GUI.

[[display_rules]]
== Display Rules

=== Dates

Dates impact both the feed rendering and the timeline rendering.

In the feed cards are visible based on a collection of filters among which a
time filter.

In the time line cards are visible based on a similar filter plus the time line
renders the "position" in time of said cards. By default, it groups cards at
close time in bubbles whom color indicates severity and inner number indicates
number of cards.

==== Start Date (`startDate`)

The card is only display after this date is reach by the current time. It's a mandatory attributes for OperatorFabric cards.

example:

The current day is the 29 january 2019.

A card with the following configuration `"startDate":1548758040000`, has a start date equals to the iso date: "2019-01-29T10:34:00Z". So the operator will see it appearing in it's feed at 10h34 AM universal time. And if there is no `endDate` defines for it, it will stay in the feed indefinitely, so this card should be still visible the 30th january 2019. Before "10h34 AM universal time", this card was not visible in the feed.

==== End Date (`endDate`)

This optional attribute, corresponds to the moment after which the card will be remove from the feed of the GUI.

example: 

Imagine that the current day is still the 29 january 2019.

The card we are looking after, has the same value for the startDate than in the previous example but has the following configuration for the `endDate`: `"endDate":1548765240000`. It's corresponding to "2019-01-29T12:34:00Z" universal time.

So our card is present in the feed between "11h34" and "13h34". Before and after those hours, the card is not available.

[[card_recipients]]
=== Recipients

The attribute `recipient` of a card tells to whom it's sent.

The available types are:

- `GROUP`: Card is sent to every user belonging to a group (identity)
- `USER` : Card is sent to a single user (identity)
- `UNION` : Card is sent to users according to the union of a recipient list (recipients)
- `DEADEND` : Card is sent to no one (mostly for testing purposes)

The simplest way to determine the recipient is to assign the card to a `user` or a `group` as seen previously in
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<minimal_card, Minimal Card>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#minimal_card, Minimal Card>>]
.

But it's possible to combine groups and potentially users using `UNION`  type to have a better control on whom should receive the card.

==== UNION

For example, if a card is destined to the operators of `TSO1` and `TSO2` and needs to be also seen by the `admin`, the recipient configuration looks like:

....
"recipient":{"type":"UNION",
	"recipients":[
		{"type":"GROUP","identity":"TSO1"},
		{"type":"GROUP","identity":"TSO2"},
		{"type":"USER","identity":"admin"}
		]
	}
....
