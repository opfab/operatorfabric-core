[[response_cards]]
= Response cards

Within your template, you can allow the user to perform some actions (respond to a form, answer a question, ...).
The user fills these information and then clicks on a submit button. When he submits this action, a new card is created
and emitted to a third-party tool.

This card is called "a child card" as it is attached to the card where the question came from : "the parent card". This
child card is also sent to the users that have received the parent card. From the ui point of view, the information of
the child cards can be integrated in real time in the parent card if configured.

The process can be represented as follows :

Notice that the response will be associated to the entity and not to the user, i.e the user responds on behalf of his
entity. A user can respond more than one time to a card (a future evolution could add the possibility to limit to one
response per entity).

You can view a screenshot of an example of card with responses :

== Steps needed to use a response card

[[define_a_third_party_tool]]
=== Define a third party tool

The response card is to be received by a third party application for business processing. The third-party application
will receive the card as an HTTP POST request. The card is in json format (the same format as when we send a card).
The field data in the json contains the user response.

The url of the third party receiving the response card is to be set in the .yml of the publication service. It is also
possible to configure whether the user token shall be propagated to the third party or not by setting the
"propagateUserToken" boolean property. Here is an example with two third parties configured.
....
external-recipients:
  recipients: 
    - id: "third-party1"
      url: "http://thirdparty1/test1"
      propagateUserToken: true
    - id: "third-party2"
      url: "http://thirdparty2:8090/test2"
      propagateUserToken: false
....

The name to use for the third-party is the publisherId of the parent card.


[WARNING]
====
For the url, do not use localhost if you run OperatorFabric in a docker, as the publication-service will not be able to
join your third party.
====

=== Configure the response in config.json

A card can have a response only if it's in a process/state that is configured for. To do that you need to define the
appropriate configuration in the config.json of the concerned process. Here is an example of configuration:

....
{
  "id": "defaultProcess",
  "name": "Test",
  "version": "1",
  "states": {
    "questionState": {
      "name": "question.title",
      "color": "#8bcdcd",
      "response": {
        "state": "responseState",
        "externalRecipients":["externalRecipient1", "externalRecipient2"]
      },
      "templateName": "question",
      "styles": [
        "style"
      ],
      "acknowledgmentAllowed": "Never",
      "showDetailCardHeader" : true
    },
    "responseState": {
      "name" : "response.title",
      "isOnlyAChildState" : true
    }
  }
}
....

We define here a state name "questionState" with a response field. Now, if we send a card with process "defaultProcess"
and state "questionState", the user will have the possibility to respond if he has the required privileges.

- The field "state" in the response field is used to define the state to use for the response (the child card).
- The field "externalRecipients" define the recipients of the response card. These recipients are the ids of the objects referenced in
the config file of cards-publication service, in "external-recipients" element. This field is optional.
- The field "emittingEntityAllowedToRespond" in the response field is used to allow the emitting entity to respond to a card. To be able to respond, however, the emitting entity has to be one of the recipients of the card. Default value is false.
- The field "showDetailCardHeader" permits to display the card header or not. This header contains the list of entities
that have already responded or not, and a countdown indicating the time remaining to respond, if necessary.
- The field "isOnlyAChildState" indicates whether the state is only used for child cards or not. If yes, the state
is displayed neither in the feed notification configuration screen nor in archives screen filters.



NOTE: The state to be used for the response can also be set dynamically based on the contents of the card or the
response by returning it in the method registered by `opfab.currentCard.registerFunctionToGetUserResponse` (see below for details).

=== Design the question form in the template

For the user to response you need to define the response form in the template with standard HTML syntax   

To enable OperatorFabric to send the response, you need to implement a javascript function in your template 
which returns an object containing four fields :

- valid (_boolean_) : true if the user input is valid
- errorMsg (_string_) : message in case of invalid user input. If valid is true this field is not necessary.
- responseCardData (_any_) : the user input to send in the data field of the child card. If valid is false this field is not necessary.
- responseState : name of the response state to use. This field is not mandatory, if it is not set the state defined in
`config.json` will be used for the response.


This method is to be registered via `opfab.currentCard.registerFunctionToGetUserResponse`, the method will be called by OperatorFabric when the user clicks on the button to send the response.

In the example below, the `getUserResponse` creates a `responseCardData` object by retrieving the user's inputs from the HTML.
In addition, if the user chose several options, it overrides the response state defined in the `config.json` with another
state.

[source,js]
----
include::../../../test/resources/bundles/defaultProcess_V1/template/question.handlebars[tag=opfab.currentCard.registerFunctionToGetUserResponse_example]
----

=== Define permissions

To respond to a card a user must have the right privileges, it is done using "perimeters". The user must be in a group
that is attached to a perimeter with  a right "ReceiveAndWrite" for the concerned process/state, the state being the response
state defined in the config.json.

Here is an example of definition of a perimeter : 
....
{
  "id" : "perimeterQuestion",
  "process" : "defaultProcess",
  "stateRights" : [
    {
      "state" : "responseState",
      "right" : "ReceiveAndWrite"
    }
  ]
}
....

To configure it in OperatorFabric , you need to make a POST of this json file to the end point /users/perimeters. 

To add it to a group name for example "mygroup", you need to make a PATCH request  to endpoint
'users/groups/mygroup/perimeters' with payload ["perimeterQuestion"]


== Send a question card

The question card is like a usual card except that you have the field "entitiesAllowedToRespond" to set with the
entities allowed to respond to the card. If the user is not in the entity, he will not be able to respond.

....

...
"process"  :"defaultProcess",
"processInstanceId" : "process4",
"state": "questionState",
"entitiesAllowedToRespond": ["ENTITY1_FR","ENTITY2_FR"],
"severity" : "ACTION",
...

....

NOTE: By default, OperatorFabric considers that if the parent card (question card) is modified, then the child cards
are deleted. If you want to keep the child cards when the parent card is changed, then you must add in the parent
card the field "keepChildCards" and set it to true.

The header in the card details will list the entities from which a response is expected, color-coding them depending
on whether they've already responded (green) or not (orange).

NOTE: You can also set the property `entitiesRequiredToRespond` to differentiate between entities can respond
(`entitiesAllowedToRespond`) and those who must respond (`entitiesRequiredToRespond`).

....

...
"process"  :"defaultProcess",
"processInstanceId" : "process4",
"state": "questionState",
"entitiesAllowedToRespond": ["ENTITY1_FR","ENTITY2_FR","ENTITY3_FR"],
"entitiesRequiredToRespond": ["ENTITY1_FR","ENTITY2_FR"],
"severity" : "ACTION",
...

....

If `entitiesRequiredToRespond` is set and not empty, the card detail header will use this list instead of
`entitiesAllowedToRespond`.

IMPORTANT: If set, `entitiesRequiredToRespond` does not have to be a subset of `entitiesAllowedToRespond`. To determine
if a user has the right to respond, OperatorFabric consider the union of the two lists.


== Integrate child cards 

For each user response, a child card containing the response is emitted and stored in OperatorFabric like a normal card. It is not directly visible on the ui but this child card can be integrated in real time to the parent card of all the users watching the card. To do that, you need  some code in the template to process child data:

You shall give a reference to a method for processing the child cards via _opfab.currentCard.listenToChildCards_ .
 
The define method shall have an array of child cards as a parameter and  will be called by OperatorFabric when loading the card and every time the list of child cards changes.

```
opfab.currentCard.listenToChildCards( (childCards) => { // process child cards });
```
=== Entity name 

If you want to show the name of an entity that send the response, you need to get the id of the entity via the publisher
field of the child card and then you  can get the name of the entity by calling _opfab.users.entities.getEntityName(entityId)_


=== Example 

You can find an example in the file https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/tree/master/src/test/resources/bundles/defaultProcess_V1/template/question.handlebars[src/test/resources/bundles/defaultProcess_V1/template/question.handlebars].


== Lock mechanism

When a user has never answered to a response card, the button will be marked as "VALIDATE ANSWER" and the card will be
unlocked.
When the user responds for the first time (and the response succeeds), the button will then be marked as "MODIFY ANSWER"
and the information that the card has been locked can be sent to the third template (see opfab.currentCard.listenToResponseLock in frontend API).

Once a user has responded to a response card, its entity status will be considered as "already answered" for this card.
Then all the users having the same entity will be in this status for this card.

From there, as soon as they will open this card the button will be marked as "MODIFY ANSWER" and this information (i.e. that this entity has already responded) is accessible to the card template (see opfab.currentCard.isResponseLocked in frontend API).

The user can then click on "MODIFY ANSWER" and the button will come back to its initial state ("VALIDATE ANSWER") and the information that the user wants to modify its initial answer can be sent to the card template (see opfab.currentCard.listenToResponseUnlock in frontend API).
