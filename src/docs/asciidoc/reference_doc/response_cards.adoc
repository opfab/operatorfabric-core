[[response_cards]]
= Response cards

Within your template, you can allow the user to perform some actions (respond to a form, answer a question, ...).
The user fills these information and then clicks on a submit button. When he submits this action, a new card is created
and emitted to a third-party tool.

This card is called "a child card" as it is attached to the card where the question came from : "the parent card". This
child card is also sent to the users that have received the parent card. From the ui point of view, the information of
the child cards can be integrated in real time in the parent card if configured.

The process can be represented as follows :

Notice that the response will be associated to the entity and not to the user, i.e the user responds on behalf of his
entity. A user can respond more than one time to a card (a future evolution could add the possibility to limit to one
response per entity).

You can view a screenshot of an example of card with responses :

== Steps needed to use a response card

=== Define a third party tool

The response card is to be received by a third party application for business processing. The third-party application
will receive the card as an HTTP POST request. The card is in json format (the same format as when we send a card).
The field data in the json contains the user response.

The url of the third party receiving the response card is to be set in the .yml of the publication service. Here is
an example with two third parties configured.
....
externalRecipients-url: "{\
           third-party1: \"http://thirdparty1/test1\", \
           third-party2: \"http://thirdparty2:8090/test2\", \
           }"
....

The name to use for the third-party is the publisherId of the parent card.


[WARNING]
====
For the url, do not use localhost if you run OperatorFabric in a docker, as the publication-service will not be able to
join your third party.
====

=== Configure the response in config.json

A card can have a response only if it's in a process/state that is configured for. To do that you need to define the
appropriate configuration in the config.json of the concerned process. Here is an example of configuration:

....
{
  "id": "defaultProcess",
  "name": "Test",
  "version": "1",
  "states": {
    "questionState": {
      "name": "question.title",
      "color": "#8bcdcd",
      "response": {
        "state": "responseState",
        "externalRecipients":["externalRecipient1", "externalRecipient2"],
        "btnText": {
          "key": "question.button.text"
        }
      },
      "templateName": "question",
      "styles": [
        "style"
      ],
      "acknowledgmentAllowed": "Never",
      "showDetailCardHeader" : true
    },
    "responseState" :{
      "name" :"response.title"
    }
  }
}
....

We define here a state name "questionState" with a response field. Now, if we send a card with process "defaultProcess"
and state "questionState", the user will have the possibility to respond if he has the required privileges.

- The field "state" in the response field is used to define the state to use for the response (the child card).
- The field "externalRecipients" define the recipients of the response card. These recipients are keys referenced in
the config file of cards-publication service, in "externalRecipients-url" element. This field is optional.
- The field "btnText" is the i18n key of the title of the submit button, it is optional.
- The field "showDetailCardHeader" permits to display the card header or not. This header contains the list of entities
that have already responded or not, and a countdown indicating the time remaining to respond, if necessary.


NOTE: The state to be used for the response can also be set dynamically based on the contents of the card or the
response by returning it in the `templateGateway.getUserResponse` method (see below for details).

=== Design the question form in the template

For the user to response you need to define the response form in the template with standard HTML syntax   

To enable operator fabric to send the response, you need to implement a javascript function in your template called
`templateGateway.getUserResponse` which returns an object containing four fields :

- valid (_boolean_) : true if the user input is valid
- errorMsg (_string_) : message in case of invalid user input. If valid is true this field is not necessary.
- responseCardData (_any_) : the user input to send in the data field of the child card. If valid is false this field is not necessary.
- responseState : name of the response state to use. This field is not mandatory, if it is not set the state defined in
`config.json` will be used for the response.

This method will be called by OperatorFabric when the user clicks on the button to send the response.

In the example below, the `getUserResponse` creates a `responseCardData` object by retrieving the user's inputs from the HTML.
In addition, if the user chose several options, it overrides the response state defined in the `config.json` with another
state.

.src/test/resources/bundles/defaultProcess_V1/template/en/question.handlebars
[source,js]
----
include::../../../test/resources/bundles/defaultProcess_V1/template/en/question.handlebars[tag=templateGateway.getUserResponse_example]
----

=== Define permissions

To respond to a card a user must have the right privileges, it is done using "perimeters". The user must be in a group
that is attached to a perimeter with  a right "ReceiveAndWrite" for the concerned process/state, the state being the response
state defined in the config.json.

Here is an example of definition of a perimeter : 
....
{
  "id" : "perimeterQuestion",
  "process" : "defaultProcess",
  "stateRights" : [
    {
      "state" : "responseState",
      "right" : "ReceiveAndWrite"
    }
  ]
}
....

To configure it in OperatorFabric , you need to make a POST of this json file to the end point /users/perimeters. 

To add it to a group name for example "mygroup", you need to make a PATCH request  to endpoint
'users/groups/mygroup/perimeters' with payload ["perimeterQuestion"]

NOTE: If you don't want OperatorFabric to check for user perimeter when responding to a card, you can add the variable "checkPerimeterForResponseCard" and set it to false, in the config file of cards-publication and in web-ui.json.

== Send a question card

The question card is like a usual card except that you have the field "entitiesAllowedToRespond" to set with the
entities allowed to respond to the card. If the user is not in the entity, he will not be able to respond.

....

...
"process"  :"defaultProcess",
"processInstanceId" : "process4",
"state": "questionState",
"entitiesAllowedToRespond": ["ENTITY1","ENTITY2"],
"severity" : "ACTION",
...

....

NOTE: By default, OperatorFabric considers that if the parent card (question card) is modified, then the child cards
are deleted. If you want to keep the child cards when the parent card is changed, then you must add in the parent
card the field "keepChildCards" and set it to true.

The header in the card details will list the entities from which a response is expected, color-coding them depending
on whether they've already responded (green) or not (orange).

NOTE: You can also set the property `entitiesRequiredToRespond` to differentiate between entities can respond
(`entitiesAllowedToRespond`) and those who must respond (`entitiesRequiredToRespond`).

....

...
"process"  :"defaultProcess",
"processInstanceId" : "process4",
"state": "questionState",
"entitiesAllowedToRespond": ["ENTITY1","ENTITY2","ENTITY3"],
"entitiesRequiredToRespond": ["ENTITY1","ENTITY2"],
"severity" : "ACTION",
...

....

If `entitiesRequiredToRespond` is set and not empty, the card detail header will use this list instead of
`entitiesAllowedToRespond`.

IMPORTANT: If set, `entitiesRequiredToRespond` does not have to be a subset of `entitiesAllowedToRespond`. To determine
if a user has the right to respond, OperatorFabric consider the union of the two lists.

WARNING: If several entities are allowed/required to respond and if the user is part of several of these entities, so
the ability for the user to respond to this card is desactivated.

== Integrate child cards 

For each user response, a child card containing the response is emitted and stored in OperatorFabric like a normal card. It is not directly visible on the ui but this child card can be integrated in real time to the parent card of all the users watching the card. To do that, you need  some code in the template to process child data:

- You can access child cards via the javascript method templateGateway.childCards() which returns an array of the child
cards. The structure of a child card is the same as the structure of a classic card.
- You need to define a method called templateGateway.applyChildCards() which implements the processing of  child cards.
This method will be called by OperatorFabric when loading the card and every time the list of child cards changes.


=== Entity name 

If you want to show the name of an entity that send the response, you need to get the id of the entity via the publisher
field of the child card and then you  can get the name of the entity by calling _templateGateway.getEntityName(entityId)_

=== Example 

You can find an example in the file src/test/resources/bundles/defaultProcess_V1/template/en/question.handlebars.

== Lock mechanism

When a user has never answered to a response card, the button will be marked as "VALIDATE ANSWER" and the card will be
unlocked.
When the user responds for the first time (and the response succeeds), the button will then be marked as "MODIFY ANSWER"
and the information that the card has been locked will be sent to the third template (by calling the _templateGateway.lockAnswer()_ function).

Once a user has responded to a response card, its entity status will be considered as "already answered" for this card.
Then all the users having the same entity will be in this status for this card.

From there, as soon as they will open this card the button will be marked as "MODIFY ANSWER" and this information (i.e. that this entity has already responded) will be send to the third template (via the _templateGateway.isLocked_ variable).

The user can then click on "MODIFY ANSWER" and the button will come back to its initial state ("VALIDATE ANSWER") and the information that the user wants to modify its initial answer will be sent to the third template (by calling the _templateGateway.unlockAnswer()_ function).

Once again, after validating its answer, the information will be sent to the third template that the card has been locked (by calling the templateGateway.lockAnswer() function).

== Response enabled
The template can know if the current user has the permission to answer by calling the _templateGateway.isUserAllowedToRespond()_ function.
An example of _templateGateway.isUserAllowedToRespond()_ usage can be found in the file src/test/resources/bundles/defaultProcess_V1/template/en/incidentInProgress.handlebars.

== Response required
The template can know if the current user is member of an Entity required to respond by calling the _templateGateway.isUserMemberOfAnEntityRequiredToRespond()_ function.
An example of _templateGateway.isUserMemberOfAnEntityRequiredToRespond()_ usage can be found in the file src/test/resources/bundles/defaultProcess_V1/template/en/question.handlebars.
 
== Last Time to Decide (`lttd`)

If the card has a last time to decide (lttd) configured, when the time is expired this information will be sent to the third template (by calling the _templateGateway.setLttdExpired(true)_ function).
