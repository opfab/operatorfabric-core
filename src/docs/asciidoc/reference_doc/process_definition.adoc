= Process: Declaration and Configuration

To declare and configure a `Process`, OperatorFabric uses `bundles`.
This section describes their content and how to use them.
An `OperatorFabric Process` is a way to define a business configuration.
Once this bundle fully created, it must be uploaded to the server through the `Businessconfig service`.

Some examples show how to configure a `process` using a `bundle` before diving in more technical details of the configuration.
The following instructions describe tests to perform on OperatorFabric to understand how customizations are possible.

== Bundle as Process declaration

A bundle contains all the configuration regarding a given business process, describing for example the various steps of the process but also how the associated cards and card details should be displayed.

Bundle are technically `tar.gz` archives containing at least a descriptor file named `config.json`.
To display the card date, some `css files`, `i18n files` and `handlebars templates` must be added.

For didactic purposes, in this section, the businessconfig bundle name is `BUNDLE_TEST` (to match the parameters used by the script).
The l10n (localization) configurations are English, referred as `en` and French, referred as `fr`.

As detailed in the `Businessconfig core service README` the bundle contains at least a metadata file called `config.json`, a `css` folder, an `i18n` folder and a `template` folder.

Except for the `config.json file`, all elements are optional.

The file organization within a bundle:

----
bundle
├── config.json
├── css
│   └── bundleTest.css
├── i18n
│   ├── en.json
│   └── fr.json
└── template
    ├── en
    │   ├── template1.handlebars
    │   └── template2.handlebars
    └── fr
        ├── template1.handlebars
        └── template2.handlebars
----

== The config.json file

It's a description file in `json` format.
It lists the content of the bundle.

*example*

[source,JSON]
----
include::../../../../services/core/businessconfig/src/main/docker/volume/businessconfig-storage/TEST/config.json[]
----

- `id`: id of the process;
- `name`: process name (i18n key);
- `version`: enables the correct display of the card data, even for the old ones.
The server store the previous versions in its file system.
This field value should match a businessconfig configuration for a correct rendering;
- `states`: lists the available states which each declares associated actions, associated templates and if cards could be acknowledged by users;
- `uiVisibility`: in the monitoring, logging and calendar screens, not all the cards are visible, it depends on the business process they are part of. For a card to be visible in these screens, the corresponding parameter must be set to true.

The mandatory field are `id`,`name` and `version`.

See the
ifdef::single-page-doc[link:../api/businessconfig/index.html[Businessconfig API documentation]]
ifndef::single-page-doc[link:{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/api/businessconfig/index.html[Businessconfig API documentation]]
for details.

== i18n

There are two ways of internationalization (i18n) for businessconfig service.
First one by using l10n files located in the `i18n` folder, the second one throughout l10n name folder nested in the `template` folder.

The `i18n` folder contains one json file per l10n.

The integration of the businessconfig service into OperatorFabric need this localisation, i.e. the label displayed for the process, the state, the label displayed for the details of the card...

===  Template folder

The `template` folder must contain l10n folder for the i18n of the card details.
This is why in our example, as the bundle contains an `en` and a `fr` l10n, the `template` folder contains an `en` and a `fr` folder.

==== i18n file

If there is no i18n file or key is missing, OperatorFabric displays i18n key, such as `BUNDLE_TEST.1.missing-i18n-key`.
In the case where the bundle declares no i18n key corresponds to `missing-i18n-key`.

The choice of i18n keys is up to the maintainer of the Businessconfig process.


*Example*

For this example, the name of the process is  `Bundle Test` and its technical name is `BUNDLE_TEST`.
The bundle provides an english and a french l10n.

Title and summary have to be localized.


Here is the content of `en.json`

[source,JSON]
----
include::../../../../services/core/businessconfig/src/main/docker/volume/businessconfig-storage/TEST/1/i18n/en.json[]
----

Here the content of `fr.json`

[source,JSON]
----
include::../../../../services/core/businessconfig/src/main/docker/volume/businessconfig-storage/TEST/1/i18n/fr.json[]
----

To check the i18n, after the upload of the bundle, use a `GET` request against the `businessconfig` service.
The simpler is to ask for the i18n file, as described
ifdef::single-page-doc[link:../api/businessconfig/index.html#/businessconfig/getI18n[here]]
ifndef::single-page-doc[link:{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/api/businessconfig/index.html#/businessconfig/getI18n[here]]
.

Set the `locale` language, the `version` of the bundle and the `technical name` of the businessconfig party to get json in the response.

For example, to check if the french l10n data of the version 1 of the `BUNDLE_TEST` businessconfig party use the following command line:

----
curl "http://localhost:2100/businessconfig/processes/BUNDLE_TEST/i18n?locale=fr&version=1" \
-H  "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"
----

where `${token}` is a valid token for operatorfabric use.

The `businessconfig` service should answer with a 200 status associated with the following json:

[source,JSON]
----
include::../../../../services/core/businessconfig/src/main/docker/volume/businessconfig-storage/TEST/1/i18n/en.json[]

----

=== Processes and States

Each Process declares associated states.
Each state declares specific templates for card details and specific actions.


The purpose of this section is to display elements of businessconfig card data in a custom format.

==== configuration

The process entry in the configuration file is a dictionary of processes, each key maps to a process definition.
A process definition is itself a dictionary of states, each key maps to a state definition.

==== Templates

For demonstration purposes, there will be two simple templates.
For more advance feature go to the section detailing the handlebars templates and associated helpers available in OperatorFabric.
As the card used in this example are created above, the bundle template folder needs to contain 2 templates: `template1.handlebars` and `template2.handlebars`.

*Examples of template (i18n versions)*

The following templates display a l10n title and a line containing the value of the scope property `card.level1.level1Prop`.
In english, the translation of this key is '_This is a root property_'.

`/template/en/template1.handlebars`

[source,html]
----
<h2>Template Number One</h2>
<div class="bundle-test">'{{card.data.level1.level1Prop}}'</div>
----

`/template/fr/template1.handlebars`

[source,html]
----
<h2>Patron numéro Un</h2>
<div class="bundle-test">'{{card.data.level1.level1Prop}}'</div>
----

The two following template examples display also a l10n title and a list of numeric values from 1 to 3.

`/template/en/template2.handlebars`

[source,html]
----
<h2>Second Template</h2>
<ul class="bundle-test-list">
	{{#each card.data.level1.level1Array}}
		<li class="bunle-test-list-item">{{this.level1ArrayProp}}</li>
	{{/each}}
</ul>
----

`/template/fr/template2.handlebars`

[source,html]
----
<h2>Second patron</h2>
<ul class="bundle-test-list">
	{{#each card.data.level1.level1Array}}
		<li class="bunle-test-list-item">{{this.level1ArrayProp}}</li>
	{{/each}}
</ul>
----

==== CSS

This folder contains regular css files.
The file name must be declared in the `config.json` file in order to be used in the templates and applied to them.

===== Examples

As above, all parts of files irrelevant for our example are symbolised by a `…` character.

*Declaration of css files in `config.json` file*

[source,json]
----
{
	…
    "states" : {
            "state1" : {
                  …
	                "styles":["bundleTest"]
                  }
              }
	…
}
----

*CSS Class used in `./template/en/template1.handlebars`*

[source,html]
----
	…
	<div class="bundle-test">'{{card.data.level1.level1Prop}}'</div>
	…
----

As seen above, the value of `{{card.data.level1.level1Prop}}` of a test card is `This is a level1 property`

*Style declaration in `./css/bundleTest.css`*

[source,css]
----
.h2{
	color:#fd9312;
	font-weight: bold;
}
----

*Expected result*

image::expected-result.png[Formatted root property]

=== Upload

To upload a bundle to the OperatorFabric server use a `POST` http request as described in the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<../api/businessconfig/#/businessconfig/uploadBundle, Businessconfig Service API documentation>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/api/businessconfig/#/businessconfig/uploadBundle, Businessconfig Service API documentation>>]
.

*Example*

[source,shell]
----
cd ${BUNDLE_FOLDER}
curl -X POST "http://localhost:2100/businessconfig/processes"\
	-H  "accept: application/json"\
	-H  "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"\
	-F "file=@bundle-test.tar.gz;type=application/gzip"
----

Where:

- `${BUNDLE_FOLDER}` is the folder containing the bundle archive to be uploaded.
- `bundle-test.tar.gz` is the name of the uploaded bundle.

These command line should return a `200 http status` response with the details of the bundle in the response body such as :

[source,json]
----
{
  "id":"BUNDLE_TEST"
  "name": "BUNDLE_TEST",
  "version": "1",
  "states" : {
          "start" : {
            "templateName" : "template1"
          },
          "end" : {
            "templateName" : "template2",
            "styles" : [ "bundleTest.css" ]
          }
      }
}
----

For further help check the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<troubleshooting_bundle, Troubleshooting>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/getting_started/index.adoc#troubleshooting_bundle, Troubleshooting>>]
section which resumes how to resolve common problems.

== Processes groups

OperatorFabric offers the possibility of defining process groups. These groups have an impact only on the UI, for
example on the notification configuration screen, by offering a more organized view of all the processes.

IMPORTANT: A process can only belong to one process group.

To define processes groups, you have to upload a file via a `POST` http request as described in the

ifdef::single-page-doc[link:../api/businessconfig/index.html#/businessconfig/uploadProcessgroups[Businessconfig Service API documentation]]
ifndef::single-page-doc[link:{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/api/businessconfig/index.html#/default/uploadProcessgroups[Businessconfig Service API documentation]]
.

*Example*

[source,shell]
----
cd ${PROCESSES_GROUPS_FOLDER}
curl -X POST "http://localhost:2100/businessconfig/processgroups"\
	-H "accept: application/json"\
	-H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"\
	-F "file=@processesGroups.json"\
	-H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}"
----

Where:

- `${PROCESSES_GROUPS_FOLDER}` is the folder containing the processes groups file to upload.
- `processesGroups.json` is the name of the uploaded file.
- `${token}` is a valid token for OperatorFabric use.

Example of content for uploaded file :
[source,json]
----
{
  "groups": [
    {
      "id": "processgroup1",
      "processes": [
        "process1",
        "process2"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "processgroup2",
      "processes": [
        "process3",
        "process4"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "locale": {
    "en": {
      "processgroup1": "Process Group 1",
      "processgroup2": "Process Group 2"
    },
    "fr": {
      "processgroup1": "Groupe de process 1",
      "processgroup2": "Groupe de process 2"
    }
  }
}

----

These command line should return a `201 http status`.
