= Archived Cards

== Key concepts

Every time a card is published, in addition to being delivered to the users
and persisted as a "current" card in MongoDB, it is also immediately
persisted in the archived cards.

Archived cards are similar in structure to current cards, but they are managed differently.
Current cards are uniquely identified by their id (made up of the publisher and the process id).
That is because if a new card is published with id as an existing card, it will replace it in the
card collection. This way, the current card reflects the current state of a process instance.
In the archived cards collection however, both cards will be kept, so that the archived cards
show all the states that a given process instance went through.

== Archives screen in the UI

The Archives screen in the UI allows the users to query these archives with different filters.
The layout of this screen is very similar to the Feed screen: the results are displayed in a
(paginated) card list, and the user can display the associated card details by clicking a card in the list.

IMPORTANT: The results of these queries are limited to cards that the user is allowed to see, either
because they are direct recipient of the card or because they belong to a group that is a recipient
of the card.

== Archive endpoints in the card-consultation API

This Archives screen relies on dedicated endpoints in the card-consultation API, as described
