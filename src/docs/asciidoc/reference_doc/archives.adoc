= Archived Cards

== Key concepts

Every time a card is published, in addition to being delivered to the users
and persisted as a "current" card in MongoDB, it is also immediately
persisted in the archived cards.

Archived cards are similar in structure to current cards, but they are managed differently.
Current cards are uniquely identified by their id (made up of the publisher and the process id).
That is because if a new card is published with id as an existing card, it will replace it in the
card collection. This way, the current card reflects the current state of a process instance.
In the archived cards collection however, both cards will be kept, so that the archived cards
show all the states that a given process instance went through.


== Archives screen in the UI

The Archives screen in the UI allows the users to query these archives with different filters.
The layout of this screen is very similar to the Feed screen: the results are displayed in a
(paginated) card list, and the user can display the associated card details by clicking a card in the list.

The results of these queries are limited to cards that the user is allowed to see, either :

** because this user is direct recipient of the card,
** because he belongs to a group (or entity) that is a recipient,
** or because he belongs to a group that has the right to receive the card (via definition of perimeters)

If a card is sent to an entity and a group, then this user must be part of both the group and the entity.

NOTE: Currently, child cards are not shown in the Archives, only the parent card is shown.

NOTE: If the user is a member of a group that has the `VIEW_ALL_ARCHIVED_CARDS` permission, the user can
see all archives, whether he is part of the recipients or not, whether he has the right to receive the card or not.
If the user is a member of a group that has the `VIEW_ALL_ARCHIVED_CARDS_FOR_USER_PERIMETERS` permission, the user
can see all archives for which he has the right to receive it, whether he is part of the recipients or not.
