[[user_cards]]
= User cards

Using the `Create card` menu, the user can send cards to entities. This feature needs to be configured.


== Configure the bundle

A card is related to a process and a state, if you want users to be able to emit a card for a specific process and
state, you need to define it in the bundle for this process.

For example : 

....
"id": "conferenceAndITIncidentExample",
"name": "conferenceAndITIncidentExample.label",
"version": "1",
"states": {
  "messageState": {
    "name": "message.title",
    "userCard" : {
      "template" : "usercard_message",
      "severityVisible" : true,
      "startDateVisible" : true,
      "endDateVisible" : true,
      "expirationDateVisible" : false,
      "lttdVisible" : false,
    },
    "templateName": "message",
    "styles": [],
    "acknowledgmentAllowed": "Always"
  }
}
....

In this example, the field userCard states that we have a template called `usercard_message` that defines how
the specific business input fields for this user card will be displayed in the card sending form that will be
presented to the user (through the `Create Card` menu).

This template works the same as templates for card presentation. Here is an example :

....

<div class="opfab-textarea">
    <label> MESSAGE </label>
    <textarea id="message" name="message" placeholder="Write something.."
        style="width:100%"> {{card.data.message}} </textarea>
</div>


<script>
    opfab.currentCard.registerFunctionToGetSpecificCardInformation( () => {
        const message = document.getElementById('message').value;
        const card = {
          summary : {key : "message.summary"},
          title : {key : "message.title"},
          data : {message: message}
        };
        if (message.length<1) return { valid:false , errorMsg:'You must provide a message'}
        return {
            valid: true,
            card: card
        };

    }
</script>
....


The first part defines the HTML for the business-specific input fields. It should only include the form
fields specific to your process, because the generic fields (like startDate , endDate , severity ... ) are presented
by default. It is possible to hide certain generic fields, by setting their visibility to false in the config.json
(for example field `severityVisible`).

Please note that you should use an OpFab css class so the "business-specific" part of the form has the same look and
feel (See
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<opfab_template_style, OperatorFabric Style >>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#opfab_template_style, OperatorFabric Style>>]
for more information)

[WARNING]
Be aware that as we have a preview of the card, the application loads the html related to the usercard (build with the
usercard template) and the html related to the card in preview (build with the card template) into the browser at the
same time. This implies that you MUST NOT name the elements with the same names in both templates. This rule applies
to HTML elements identifiers(id), global JavaScript variables and JavaScript function names.



Once the card has been sent, users with the appropriate rights can edit it. If they choose to do so, they're presented
with the same input form as for the card creation, but the fields are pre-filled with the current data of the card.
This way, they can only change what they need without having to re-create the card from scratch.
That's what the reference to `{{card.data.message}}` is for. It means that this text-area input field should be filled
with the value of the field `message` from the card's data.

The second part is a javascript method you need to implement to allow OperatorFabric to get your specific data .

To have a better understanding of this feature, we encourage you to have a look at the examples in the OperatorFabric
core repository under (https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/tree/develop/src/test/resources/bundles/conferenceAndITIncidentExample[src/test/resources/bundles/conferenceAndITIncidentExample]).


== Method registerFunctionToGetSpecificCardInformation

The following card fields can be set via the object `card` in the object returned by method the method register via
registerFunctionToGetSpecificCardInformation:

* title 
* summary
* startDate (epoch date in ms)
* endDate (epoch date in ms)
* expirationDate (epoch date in ms)
* lttd (epoch date in ms)
* keepChildCards (deprecated, use 'actions' field including "KEEP_CHILD_CARDS" action instead)
* secondsBeforeTimeSpanForReminder
* severity (in case it is not visible from the user , when `severityVisible` set to false in `config.json`)
* data
* entityRecipients
* entitiesAllowedToEdit
* entitiesAllowedToRespond
* entitiesRequiredToRespond
* externalRecipients (used to send cards to third party , see
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<define_a_third_party_tool, Define a third party tool >>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#define_a_third_party_tool, Define a third party tool>>]
for more information).
* rRule (used to define a card with recurrence, see
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<_using_rrule_field, Using rRule field >>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#_using_rrule_field, Using rRule field>>]
for more information).
* tags (list of strings)
* wktGeometry (string)
* wktProjection (string)
* actions (list of card actions)

If you send a card to an ExternalRecipient, when the user delete it, the external recipient will receive the information via an HTTP DELETE request with the id of the deleted card at the end of the request (example : http://myexternal_app/myendpoint/ID_CARD).

If you want the card to be visible in the calendar feature, you need to set 'timeSpans' field (as array of TimeSpans objects) in the object returned by the method. 
You can find an example in the file:
https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/tree/master/src/test/resources/bundles/taskExample/template/usercard_task.handlebars[src/test/resources/bundles/taskExample/template/usercard_task.handlebars].

If not using 'timeSpans' it's possible to set the 'viewCardInCalendar' field to true, the card will be visible using card's startDate and endDate as default timeSpan.

The 'recurrence' field is deprecated and could be removed in the future.


If the form is not filled correctly by the user, you can provide an error message (see example above).
Again, have a look to the examples provided. 


== Define permissions

To send a user card, the user must be member of a group that has a perimeter defining the right `ReceiveAndWrite`
or `Write` for the chosen process and state. For example:

....
{
  "id" : "perimeterUserCard",
  "process" : "conferenceAndITIncidentExample",
  "stateRights" : [
    {
      "state" : "messageState",
      "right" : "ReceiveAndWrite"
    }
  ]
}
....


NOTE: Using the `ReceiveAndWrite` right instead of the `Write` right allows the user to receive the card they sent and
edit or delete it.

[[restrict_possible_emitters]]
== Restrict the list of possible emitter entities

When sending a user card, if the user is member of multiple entities, it is possible to choose the emitter entity from all the available user entities. To limit the list of available emitter entities, it is possible to configure the property `publisherList` in userCard state definition with the list of allowed publisher entities.
For example : 

....
"processState": {
      "name": "Process example ",
      "description": "Process state",
      "userCard" : {
        "template" : "usercard_process",
        "expirationDateVisible" : true,
        "publisherList": [{"id":"ENTITY_FR", "levels":[1]},{"id":"IT_SUPERVISOR_ENTITY"}]
      }
....
In this example the list of available publisher entities will contain all the first level children of "ENTITY_FR" (level 1) and "IT_SUPERVISOR_ENTITY".


[[set_recipients_via_code]]
== Set the list of recipients via the template

To do that, you have to provide the list of recipients when returning the card object in the field `entityRecipients`.

Example:
....

    opfab.currentUserCard.registerFunctionToGetSpecificCardInformation( () => {
        const message = document.getElementById('message').value;
        const card = {
          summary : {key : "message.summary"},
          title : {key : "message.title"},
          entityRecipients: ["ENTITY_FR","IT_SUPERVISOR_ENTITY"],
          data : {message: message}
        };
        if (message.length<1) return { valid:false , errorMsg:'You must provide a message'}
        return {
            valid: true,
            card: card
        }
  });

....

When recipient dropdown is not visible to the user (attribute `recipientVisible` set to `false` in state definition in config.json) the final recipients list will be the one defined in the template, otherwise it will be the union of user selection and template `entityRecipients` definition.


== Card editing
Once a user card has been sent it can be edited by a user member of the publisher entity who has write access for the process/state of the card.
It is possible to allow other entities to edit the card by specifying the 'entitiesAllowedToEdit' card field.
It is possible to hide card edit button on UI by setting 'editCardEnabledOnUserInterface' to false in card's process/state definition.

== Card copy
A user can copy a card and send it if he has write access for the process/state of the card. Before sending the card, the user can modify it if he wants.
It is possible to hide card copy button on UI by setting 'copyCardEnabledOnUserInterface' to false in card's process/state definition.

== Card delete
Once a user card has been sent it can be deleted by a user member of the publisher entity who has write access for the process/state of the card.
It is possible to hide card delete button on UI by setting 'deleteCardEnabledOnUserInterface' to false in card's process/state definition.


== Send response automatically (experimental feature)

It is possible to configure a template to automatically send a response when sending a user card expecting an answers from one of the entities of the emitting user. 
The response card will be sent only if the user is enabled to respond to the card.
 
To enable the automated response the template should add a `childCard` field to the object returned by 
 `getSpecificCardInformation` method. For example:

....
 <script>
     opfab.currentUserCard.registerFunctionToGetSpecificCardInformation( () =>  {
        const card = {...}

        childCard : { 
          summary : {key : "example.summary"},
          title : {key : "example.title"},
          state : "mystateForResponse"
          data : {
                  // specific child  card date 
                  }
          };
        ...
        return {
            valid: true,
            card: card,
            childCard: childCard
        };

    });
  </script>
....

The card preview will display the card detail with the automated response as it will be displayed in Feed page.

When editing a user card, the template can get the response sent by current user by calling the
_opfab.currentUserCard.getUserEntityChildCard_ function.

By default, the publisher of the childCard is the publisher of the parent card. In the template, it is possible to
set another value for the publisher of the childCard, provided that the user is a member of the entity publisher you
want to set.

== Misc

When a user send a card, the card is also sent to the members of the entity that publish the card (and therefore also to
the sender himself), whatever the user chooses in the recipient list.
