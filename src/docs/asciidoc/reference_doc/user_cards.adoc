[[user_cards]]
= User cards

Using the `Create card` menu, the user can send cards to entities. This feature needs to be configured.


== Configure the bundle

A card is related to a process and a state, if you want users to be able to emit a card for a specific process and state,
you need to define it in the bundle for this process.

For example : 

....
"id": "userCardExamples",
"name": "userCardExamples.label",
"version": "1",
"states": {
  "messageState": {
    "name": "message.title",
    "userCard" : {
      "template" : "usercard_message",
      "severityVisible" : true,
      "startDateVisible" : true,
      "endDateVisible" : true,
      "lttdVisible" : false,
      "recipientList" : [{"id": "ALLCONTROLROOMS", "levels": [0,1]}, {"id": "ENTITY4"}]
    },
    "templateName": "message",
    "styles": [],
    "acknowledgmentAllowed": "Always"
  }
}
....

In this example, the field userCard states that we have a template called `usercard_message` that defines how
the specific business input fields for this user card will be displayed in the card sending form that will be
presented to the user (through the `Create Card` menu).

This template works the same as templates for card presentation. Here is an example :

....

<div class="opfab-textarea">
    <label> MESSAGE </label>
    <textarea id="message" name="message" placeholder="Write something.."
        style="width:100%"> {{card.data.message}} </textarea>
</div>


<script>
    templateGateway.getSpecificCardInformation = function () {
        const message = document.getElementById('message').value;
        const card = {
          summary : {key : "message.summary"},
          title : {key : "message.title"},
          data : {message: message}
        };
        if (message.length<1) return { valid:false , errorMsg:'You must provide a message'}
        return {
            valid: true,
            card: card
        };

    }
</script>
....


The first part defines the HTML for the business-specific input fields. It should only include the form
fields specific to your process, because the generic fields (like startDate , endDate , severity ... ) are presented
by default. It is possible to hide certain generic fields, by setting their visibility to false in the config.json
(for example field `severityVisible`).

Please note that you should use an OpFab css class so the "business-specific" part of the form has the same look and
feel (See
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<opfab_template_style, OperatorFabric Style >>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#opfab_template_style, OperatorFabric Style>>]
for more information)

Once the card has been sent, users with the appropriate rights can edit it. If they choose to do so, they're presented
with the same input form as for the card creation, but the fields are pre-filled with the current data of the card.
This way, they can only change what they need without having to re-create the card from scratch.
That's what the reference to `{{card.data.message}}` is for. It means that this text-area input field should be filled
with the value of the field `message` from the card's data.

The second part is a javascript method you need to implement to allow OperatorFabric to get your specific data .

To have a better understanding of this feature, we encourage you to have a look at the examples in the OperatorFabric
core repository under (https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/tree/develop/src/test/resources/bundles/userCardExamples[src/test/resources/bundles/userCardExamples]).


== Method getSpecificCardInformation

The following card fields can be set via the object `card` in the object returned by method `getSpecificCardInformation`:

* title 
* summary
* keepChildCard
* secondsBeforeTimeSpanForReminder
* severity (in case it is not visible from the user , when `severityVisible` set to false in `config.json`)
* data 

If you want the card to be visible in the agenda feature, you need to set 'viewCardInAgenda' to true in the object returned by the method.

If the form is not filled correctly by the user, you can provide an error message (see example above).
Again, have a look to the examples provided. 


== Define permissions

To send a user card, the user must be member of a group that has a perimeter defining the right `ReceiveAndWrite`
or `Write` for the chosen process and state. For example:

....
{
  "id" : "perimeterUserCard",
  "process" : "userCardExamples",
  "stateRights" : [
    {
      "state" : "messageState",
      "right" : "ReceiveAndWrite"
    }
  ]
}
....


NOTE: Using the `ReceiveAndWrite` right instead of the `Write` right allows the user to receive the card they sent and
edit or delete it.

== Recipients
When sending a user card, by default it is possible to choose the recipients from all the available entities. To limit the list of available recipients it is possible to configure the field `recipientList` in `config.json`

For example : 

....

"states": {
  "messageState": {
    "name": "message.title",
    "userCard" : {
      "template" : "usercard_message",
      "severityVisible" : true,
      "startDateVisible" : true,
      "endDateVisible" : true,
      "lttdVisible" : false,
      "recipientList" : [{"id": "ALLCONTROLROOMS", "levels": [0,1]}, {"id": "ENTITY4"}]
    },
    "templateName": "message",
    "styles": [],
    "acknowledgmentAllowed": "Always"
  }
}
....

In this example the list of available recipients will contain: "ALLCONTROLROOMS" (level 0), all the first level children of "ALLCONTROLROOMS" (level 1) and "ENTITY4".

== Misc

When a user send a card, it is always sent to himself whatever he chooses in the recipient list.
