= Email Notifications

OpFab can send card notifications via email. These notifications are sent when a new card is published for a user, remains unread for a configured period, and the user is not connected to OpFab. The email subject includes the card title, summary, and start and end dates. The email body contains a link to the card details in OpFab.

== Configuring Email Notifications

Users can enable email notifications in their user settings. They must provide an email address for receiving notifications and select the processes/states they want to be notified about.
