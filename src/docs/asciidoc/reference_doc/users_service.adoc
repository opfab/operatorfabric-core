= OperatorFabric Users Service

The User service manages users and groups.

Users:: represent account information for person destined to receive cards in the OperatorFabric instance.
Groups::
- represent set of users destined to receive collectively some cards.
- can be used in a way to handle rights on card reception in OperatorFabric.

WARNING: The user define here is an internal representation of the individual card recipient in `OperatorFabric` the authentication is leave to specific OAuth2 external service.

NOTE: In the following commands the `$token` is an authentication token currently valid for the `OAuth2` service used by the current `OperatorFabric` system.


== Users and Groups

User service manager users and groups.

=== Users

Users are the individuals and mainly physical person who can log in OperatorFabric.

The access to this service has to be authorized, in the `OAuth2` service used by the current `OperatorFabric` instance, at least to access User information and to manage Users. The membership of groups is stored in the user information.

==== Automated user creation

In case of an user does exist in a provided authentication service but he does not exist in the `OperatorFabric` instance, when he is authenticated and connected
for the first time in the `OperatorFabric` instance, the user is automatically created in the system with no attached groups.
The administration of the groups is dealt by the administrator manually. More details about automated user creation

.

=== Groups
opfab_spec_conf
The notion of group is loose and can be used to simulate role in `OperatorFabric`.
Groups are used to send cards to several users without name them specifically.The information about membership to a
group is stored in the user information. The rules used to send cards are described in the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<card_recipients, recipients section>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference/index.adoc#card_recipients, recipients section>>]
.

==== Alternative way to manage groups

The standard way to handle groups in `OperatorFabric` instance is dealt on the user information.
There is an alternative way to manage groups through the authentication token, the groups are defined by the
administrator of the authentication service.
