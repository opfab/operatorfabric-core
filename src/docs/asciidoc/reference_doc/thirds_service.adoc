= Thirds service

As stated above, third-party applications (or "thirds" for short) interact with OperatorFabric by sending cards.
The Thirds service allows them to tell OperatorFabric

* how these cards should be rendered
* what actions should be made available to the operators regarding a given card
* if several languages are supported, how cards should be translated

In addition, it lets third-party applications define additional menu entries for the navbar (for example linking back
to the third-party application) that can be integrated either as iframe or external links.
