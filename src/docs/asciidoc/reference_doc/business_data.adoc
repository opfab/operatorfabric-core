[[business_data]]
= Business Data

Using the API, it is now possible to store business data and then call it from the templates. This storage system is intended for light documents and should not be treated as a database.


== Pushing data

It is expected for the data being pushed to be compliant with the `json` format. The different methods are detailed in the (https://opfab.github.io/documentation/current/api/businessconfig/#/default/getBusinessData[API documentation]). The default limit of file size accepted is 100 MB, it can be updated in the nginx configuation.


== Calling a resource

Once a resource has been stored, it is possible to call it from the template of a card. See in this template (https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/tree/develop/src/test/resources/bundles/conferenceAndITIncidentExample/template/usercard_incidentInProgress.handlebars[usercard_incidentInProgress.handlebars]) how the resource `services` is called with the method `opfab.businessconfig.businessData.get()`

This prevents writing directly in the template's code long lists and allows easy data duplication between templates.
