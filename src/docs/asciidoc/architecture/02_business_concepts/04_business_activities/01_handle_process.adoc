==== Handle Business Processes
===== Handle Business Process instance

Description::
Handles defined business process instances from start event to end event. The
handling of business process instance instantiate a business process instance
upon predefined business start event and rules the interaction between
operators and 3rd Party Information Services.
Result control requirements::
Result control required for each business process instance and each state of
the instance
Importance::
* Business Process instance must complete in one of the Business Process
allowed end state;
* No failure allowed outside business process specific error cases.
Quality Characteristics:: (Metrics TBLD)
Security Characteristics:: Only allowed actors of business process may
interact with it (current state consultation, interactions)
Input::
 To start:::
  * Business process start event ;
  * Business process definition;
During processing:::
 * Operator input event ;
 * 3rd Party Service input event ;
Output:: Business Process end event
Business Goal:: <<BCL-G-02, BCL-G-02>> ; <<BCL-G-03, BCL-G-03>> ;
Behavior:: &nbsp;

Notes::
* Depending on future implementation decisions the above described process
instance handling loop may be delegated to an external business process
management system (ResponsabilityTLD partition), the sole responsibility for
the Operator-Fabric system would then be to handle card and user inputs.
* The “Handle Card” Action refers to the Handle Card Activity described bellow

===== Handle Card

Description:: Handles new card input representing the state of an externally
defined process.
Result control requirements:: Result control required for each card instance
Importance:: No data loss allowed
Quality Characteristics::
* Card input volumetry (count/size);
* Card propagation time through the system.
Security Characteristics:: Only allowed <<Operator>>s may be recipient of the
card.
Input::
 To start:::
  * Card data.
During processing:::
  * Operator input event.
Output:: Card and events
Business Goal:: <<BCL-G-01, BCL-G-01>>
Parent Activity:: <<Handle Business Process instance>>
Behavior:: &nbsp;

===== Handle Feed Activity
Description:: Handles card routing from server to user. Routing is based on Feed
subscription data.
A Feed of card is an updatable ensemble of cards, it consist of both the
card previously published and the new incoming cards in the system.
It is characterized by the following:
* The connected user is a recipient of the cards;
* The feed of cards is related to a time span or a collection of time span
defined by a start and an end.
Result control requirements:: Result control required on each card or deletion
operation
Importance:: No data loss allowed if user is disconnected/reconnected
Quality Characteristics:: Card Volumetry must be monitored (count/size)
Security Characteristics:: No usurpation allowed on connection recovery
Input::
 To start:::
  * Feed Subscription data (User identification and time spans).
 During processing:::
  * New Card notification ;
  * Card Deletion Operation
Output:: Continuously updated Card Feed
Business Goals:: <<BCL-G-01, BCL-G-01>> ; <<BCL-G-02, BCL-G-02>> ; <<BCL-G-03, BCL-G-03>>
Parent Activity:: <<Handle Feed Activity>>
Behavior:: &nbsp;

===== Handle Card Consultation Activity

Description:: Handles card consultation from the main user interface. The
Cards are accessible throught a Card Feed which displays associated cards
( See <<Handle Feed Activity>> above).
A card feed displays cards. There are two interaction possible with cards:
* Display a specific card details, which are formatted views on the card
associated business data;
* Submit a card action, actions are buttons available from the card itself or
its details which triggers events in business process. These events may be
attached with input data.

Result control requirements:: No specific control
Importance::
* Ensure correct ordering of cards to present most important;
* New cards and deletion operation must trigger fast UX update
information first.
Security Characteristics::
* Authenticated and authorized operators only;
* Operator can only access cards he was a recipient;
Input::
 To start:::
  * Cards;
 During processing:::
  * New Card notification ;
Business Goal:: <<BCL-G-03, BCL-G-03>>
Parent Activity:: <<Handle Feed Activity>>
Behavior:: &nbsp;
