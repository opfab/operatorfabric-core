[[architecture]]
= OperatorFabric Architecture

== Introduction

include::{gradle-rootdir}/README.adoc[tag=short_description]

The aim of this document is to describe the architecture of the solution, first by defining the business concepts it
deals with and then showing how this translates into the technical architecture.

== Business Architecture

OperatorFabric is based on the concept of *cards*, which contain data regarding events that are relevant for the
operator.
A third party tool publishes cards and the cards are received on the screen of the operators. Depending on the type
of the cards, the operator can send back information to the third party via an "action".

=== Business components

image::FunctionalDiagram.jpg[functional diagram]

To do the job, the following business components are defined :

- Card Publication : this component receives the cards from third party tools
- Card Consultation : this component delivers the cards to the operators and provide access to all cards exchanged (archives)
- Actions : this component receives the action from the operator and send it to the third party tool
- Card rendering and process definition : this component stores the information for the card rendering (templates, internationalization, ...) and a light description of the process associate (states, actions, ...). This configuration data can be provided either by an administrator or by a third party tool.
- User Management : this component is used to manage users, groups and entities.

=== Business objects 

The business objects can be represented as follows :

image::BusinessObjects.jpg[business objects diagram]

* Card : the core business object which contains the data to show to the user(or operator) 
* Publisher : the third party which publishes cards
* User : the operator receiving cards and responding via actions
* Group : a group (containing a list of users)
* Entity : an entity (containing a list of users)
* Process : the process the card is dealing with 
* State : the step in the process
* Card Rendering : data for card rendering 
* Action : a list of possible actions for a specific state in a process

== Technical Architecture

The architecture is based on micro-services. All business services are accessible via REST API.

=== Business components

We find here the business component seen before:

* We have a "UI" component which stores the static pages and the UI code that is downloaded by the browser. The UI is based an https://angular.io/[Angular] and  https://handlebarsjs.com/[Handlebars] for the card templating.
* The business component named  "Card rendering and process definition" is at the technical level known as "Third service". This service receive card rendering and process definition as a bundle. The bundle is a tar.gz file containing
	** json process configuration file (containing states & actions)
	** templates for rendering
	** stylesheets 
	** internationalization information
 
 
All business components are based on https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[SpringBoot] and packaged via https://www.docker.com/[Docker]. 

https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html[Spring WebFlux] is used to provide the card in a fluid way.

=== Technical components 
 
==== Registry

It is the central component where all services are registered. It serves as a reference point for the gateway and other
services to find information about the running services instance and allow for local load balancing of accesses. It is implemented by https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-netflix[Spring Cloud Netflix] . 

==== Gateway

It provides a filtered view of the APIS and static served pages for external access through browsers or other http
compliant accesses. It provides the rooting and load balancing for accessing the micro-services from outside. It is implemented by https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/html/[Spring Cloud Gateway].

==== Configuration

A configuration service is not mandatory in a micro-services architecture but may allow for better sharing of common configuration and
to dispatch global configuration changes to all services. It is implemented via https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/reference/html/[Spring Cloud Config].

==== Broker

The broker is used to share information asynchronously across the whole services. It is implemented via https://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ]

==== Authentication

The architecture provides a default authentication service via https://www.keycloak.org/[KeyCloak] but it can delegate it to an external provider. Authentication is done through the use of  Oauth2, three flows are supported : implicit, authorization code and password.

==== Database 

The cards are stored in a https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDb] database. The bundles are stored in a file system.
