= OperatorFabric Getting Started

== Prerequisites 
To use OperatorFabric, you need a linux OS with the following:
  
- Docker install with 4Gb of space 
- 16Gb of RAM minimal, 32 Gb recommended

== Install and run server

To start OperatorFabric, you first need to clone the getting started git


----
git clone https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-getting-started.git
----
Launch the `startserver.sh` in the server directory. You need to wait for all the services to start (it usually takes one minute to start), it is done when no more logs are written on the output (It could continue to log but slowly).

Test the connection to the UI: to connect to OperatorFabric, open in a browser the following page: http://localhost:2002/ui/ and use `operator1` as login and `test` as password.

After connection, you should see the following screen

image::empty-opfab-page.png[empty opfab screenshot]

To stop the server (if you start it in background), use:

----
docker-compose down & 
----

== Examples 

For each example, useful files and scripts are in the directory `client/exampleX`.

All examples assume you connect to the server from `localhost` (otherwise change the provided scripts)
 
=== Example 1: Send and update a basic card

Go in directory `client/example1` and send a card, using the provided script :

----
./sendCard.sh card.json 
----

The result should be a 201 Http status, and a json object such as:

[source,JSON]
----
{"count":1,"message":"All pushedCards were successfully handled"}
----

See the result in the UI, you should see a card, if you click on it you'll see the detail

image::formated-card-details.png[detail card screenshot]

==== Anatomy of the card : 
A card is containing information regarding the publisher, the recipients, the process, the data to show... 

More information can be found in the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<card_structure, Card Structure>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#card_structure, Card Structure>>]
section of the reference documentation.

[source,JSON]
----
{
	"publisher" : "message-publisher",
	"processVersion" : "1",
	"process" :"defaultProcess",
	"processInstanceId" : "hello-world-1",
	"state" : "messageState",
	"groupRecipients": ["Dispatcher"],
	"severity" : "INFORMATION",
	"startDate" : 1553186770681,
	"summary" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.summary"},
	"title" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.title"},
	"data" : {"message" :"Hello World !!! That's my first message"}
}

----

NOTE: If you open the json file of the card, you will see '${current_date_in_milliseconds_from_epoch}' for the field 'startDate'.
      We have used this so that the date of the card is the current day (or the next day in some other examples). Indeed, in the shell script
      that sends the card, you will see that we create an environment variable with the current date which is then injected
      into the json file.

==== Update the card 

We can send a new version of the card (updateCard.json):

- change the message, field data.message in the JSON File
- the severity , field severity in the JSON File

[source,JSON]
----
{
	"publisher" : "message-publisher",
	"processVersion" : "1",
	"process"  :"defaultProcess",
	"processInstanceId" : "hello-world-1",
	"state" : "messageState",
	"groupRecipients": ["Dispatcher"],
	"severity" : "ALARM",
	"startDate" : 1553186770681,
	"summary" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.summary"},
	"title" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.title"},
	"data" : {"message" :":That's my second message"}
}
----

You can send the updated card with:

----
./sendCard.sh cardUpdate.json
----

The card should be updated on the UI.

==== Delete the card 

You can delete the card using DELETE HTTP code with reference to publisher and processInstanceId
----
curl -s -X DELETE http://localhost:2102/cards/defaultProcess.hello-world-1
---- 

or use provided script:
----
./deleteCard.sh
----

=== Example 2: Publish a new bundle

The way the card is display in the UI is defined via a Bundle containing templates and process description.

The bundle structure is the following:

----
├── css : stylesheets files
├── i18n :   internalization files
└── template : 
    ├── en : handlebar templates for detail card rendering
    ├── ....
config.json : process description and global configuration 
----

The bundle is provided in the bundle directory of example2. It contains a new version of the bundle used in example1.

We just change the template and the stylesheet instead of displaying:
----
Message :  The message
----
we display:
----
You received the following message

The message 
----

If you look at the template file (template/en/template.handlebars):
[source,handlebars]
----
<h2> You received the following message </h2>

{{card.data.message}} 
----

In the stylesheet css/style.css we just change the color value to red (#ff0000):
[source,css]
----
h2{
	color:#ff0000;
	font-weight: bold;
}
----

The global configuration is defined in config.json :

[source,JSON]
----
{
	"id":"defaultProcess",
	"version":"2",
	"states":{
		"messageState" : {
			"templateName" : "template",
			"styles" : [ "style" ]
		}
	}
}
----
To keep the old bundle, we create a new version by setting version to 2.

==== Package your bundle

Your bundle need to be package in a tar.gz file, a script is available 
----
./packageBundle.sh
---- 

A file name bundle.tar.gz will be created.

==== Get a Token 

To send the bundle you need to be authenticated. To get a token you can *source* the provided script:

----
source ./getToken.sh
----

This will run the following command:

----
curl -s -X POST -d "username=admin&password=test&grant_type=password&client_id=opfab-client" http://localhost:2002/auth/token
----

This should return a JSON a response like this:

[source,JSON]
----

----

Your token is the `access_token` value in the JSON, which the script will export to a `$token` environment variable.

The sendBundle.sh script below will use of this variable.

NOTE: The token will be valid for 10 hours, after you will need to ask for a new one.

==== Send the bundle 

Executing the sendBundle.sh script will send the bundle.

You can now execute the script, it will send the bundle. 

----
./sendBundle.sh
----

You should received the following JSON in response, describing your bundle.

[source,JSON]
----
{"id":"defaultProcess","name":null,"version":"2","uiVisibility":null,"states":{"messageState":{"responseData":null,"acknowledgementAllowed":true,"color":null,"name":null,"userCard":null,"templateName":"template","styles":["style"],"acknowledgmentAllowed":true,"response":null}}}
----

==== Send a card 

You can send the following card to test your new bundle:

[source,JSON]
----
{
	"publisher" : "message-publisher",
	"processVersion" : "2",
	"process"  :"defaultProcess",
	"processInstanceId" : "hello-world-1",
	"state": "messageState",
	"groupRecipients": ["Dispatcher"],
	"severity" : "INFORMATION",
	"startDate" : 1553186770681,
	"summary" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.summary"},
	"title" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.title"},
	"data" : {"message":"Hello world in new version"}
}
----

To use the new bundle, we set processVersion to "2"

To send the card:

----
./sendCard.sh
----
You should see in the UI the detail card with the new template.

==== Internationalization
If you switch language to French in the UI (Settings menu on the top right of the screen), you should see the
cards in french.

OperatorFabric will use templates define in repository "template/fr" and keys define in "i18n/fr.json".

=== Example 3: Process with state

For this example, we will set the following process:

- Step 1: A critical situation arises on the High Voltage grid
- Step 2: The critical situation evolve
- Step 3: The critical situation ends

To model this process in OperatorFabric, we will use a "Process" with "States", we will model this in the `config.json`
of the bundle:

[source,JSON]
----
{
	"id":"criticalSituation",
	"name": "process.name",
	"version":"1",
	"states":{
		"criticalSituation-begin" : {
			"templateName" : "criticalSituationTemplate",
			"styles" : [ "style" ],
			"acknowledgmentAllowed": "Always"
		},
		"criticalSituation-update" : {
			"templateName" : "criticalSituationTemplate",
			"styles" : [ "style" ],
			"acknowledgmentAllowed": "Always"
		},
		"criticalSituation-end" : {
			"templateName" : "endCriticalSituationTemplate",
			"styles" : [ "style" ],
			"acknowledgmentAllowed": "Always"
		}
	}
}

----

You can see in the JSON we define a process name "criticalSituation" with 3 states: criticalSituation-begin,
criticalSituation-update and criticalSituation-end. For each state we define a title for the card, and the template
a stylesheets to use.

The title is a key which refer to an i18n found in the corresponding i18n repository:

[source,JSON]
----
{
    "process": {
      "name": "Critical situation process"
    },
	"criticalSituation-begin":{
		"title":"CRITICAL SITUATION",
		"summary":" CRITICAL SITUATION ON THE GRID , SEE DETAIL FOR INSTRUCTION"
	},
        "criticalSituation-update":{
                "title":"CRITICAL SITUATION - UPDATE",
                "summary":" CRITICAL SITUATION ON THE GRID , SEE DETAIL FOR INSTRUCTION"
        },
        "criticalSituation-end":{
                "title":"CRITICAL SITUATION - END",
                "summary":" CRITICAL SITUATION ENDED"
	}

}
---- 

The templates can be found in the template directory.

We can now send cards and simulate the process, first we send a card at the beginning of the critical situation:

[source,JSON]
----
{
	"publisher" : "alert-publisher",
	"processVersion" : "1",
	"process"  :"criticalSituation",
	"processInstanceId" : "alert1",
	"state": "criticalSituation-begin",
	"groupRecipients": ["Dispatcher"],
	"severity" : "ALARM",
	"startDate" : 1553186770681,
	"summary" : {"key" : "criticalSituation-begin.summary"},
	"title" : {"key" : "criticalSituation-begin.title"},
	"data" : {"instruction":"Critical situation on the grid : stop immediatly all maintenance on the grid"}
}
----

The card refers to the process "criticalSituation" as defined in the config.json, the state attribute is put to
"criticalSituation-begin" which is the first step of the process, again as defined in the config.json. The card can be sent via provided script :

----
./sendCard.sh card.json
----

Two other card have be provided to continue the process

- cardUpdate.json: the state is criticalSituation-update
- cardEnd.json: the state is criticalSituation-end and severity set to "compliant"

You can send these cards:
----
./sendCard.sh cardUpdate.json
----

----
./sendCard.sh cardEnd.json
----

=== Example 4: Time Line

To view the card in the time line, you need to set times in the card using timeSpans attributes as in the following card:

[source,JSON]
----
 {
	"publisher" : "scheduledMaintenance-publisher",
	"processVersion" : "1",
	"process"  :"maintenanceProcess",
	"processInstanceId" : "maintenance-1",
	"state": "planned",
	"groupRecipients": ["Dispatcher"],
	"severity" : "INFORMATION",
	"startDate" : 1553186770681,
	"summary" : {"key" : "maintenanceProcess.summary"},
	"title" : {"key" : "maintenanceProcess.title"},
	"data" : {
		"operationDescription":"Maintenance operation on the International France England (IFA) High Voltage line ",
		"operationResponsible":"RTE",
		"contactPoint":"By Phone : +33 1 23 45 67 89 ",
		"comment":"Operation has no impact on service"
		},
	"timeSpans" : [
        {"start" : 1576080876779},
        {"start" : 1576104912066}
    	]
}
----

For this example, we use a new publisher called "scheduledMaintenance-publisher". You won't need to post the
corresponding bundle to the businessconfig service as it has been loaded in advance to be available out of the box (only for the
getting started). If you want to take a look at its content you can find it under
server/businessconfig-storage/scheduledMaintenance-publisher/1.

Before sending the provided card provided, you need to set the good time values as
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch_(computing)[epoch] (ms) in the json. For each value you set, you will have a
point in the timeline. In our example, the first point represent the beginning of the maintenance operation, and the
second the end of the maintenance operation.

To get the dates in Epoch, you can use the following commands:

For the first date: 
---- 
date -d "+ 60 minutes" +%s%N | cut -b1-13
----

And for the second 
---- 
date -d "+ 120 minutes" +%s%N | cut -b1-13
----

To send the card use the provided script in example4 directory 

----
./sendCard.sh card.json
----

A second card (card2.json) is provided as example, you need again to set times values in the json file and then send it 

----
./sendCard.sh card2.json
----
This time the severity of the card is ALERT, you should see the point in red in the timeline

=== Example 5: Card routing mechanism

==== Card sent to a group
As we saw previously, if a card is sent to a group, then you only need to be a member of the group to receive it.

==== Card sent to an entity
If a card is sent to an entity, then you must be a member of this entity and have the process / state of the card within the user's perimeter. As the perimeters are attached to groups, the user must therefore be a member of a group attached to this perimeter.

Let's send this card :
[source,JSON]
----
{
    "publisher" : "message-publisher",
    "processVersion" : "1",
    "entityRecipients" : ["ENTITY1"],
    "process" :"defaultProcess",
    "processInstanceId" : "cardExample5",
    "state" : "messageState",
    "severity" : "INFORMATION",
    "startDate" : 1553186770681,
    "summary" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.summary"},
    "title" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.title"},
    "data" : {"message" : "Hello World !!! Here is a message for ENTITY1"}
}
----

Use the provided script :
----
./sendCard.sh cardSentToEntity.json
----

The result should be a 201 Http status, and a json object such as:

[source,JSON]
----
{"count":1,"message":"All pushedCards were successfully handled"}
----

See the result in the UI, you should not see the card.

Now let's create this perimeter :
[source,JSON]
----
{
  "id" : "getting-startedPerimeter",
  "process" : "defaultProcess",
  "stateRights" : [
    {
      "state" : "messageState",
      "right" : "Receive"
    }
  ]
}
----
You can use this command line :
----
curl -X POST http://localhost:2103/perimeters -H "Content-type:application/json" -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" --data @perimeter.json
----

or use the provided script :
----
./createPerimeter.sh perimeter.json
----

The result should be a 201 Http status, and a json object such as:

[source,JSON]
----
{"id":"getting-startedPerimeter","process":"defaultProcess","stateRights":[{"state":"messageState1","right":"Receive"},{"state":"messageState2","right":"ReceiveAndWrite"}]}
----

Now let's attach this perimeter to the Dispatcher group.
You can use this command line :
----
curl -X PUT http://localhost:2103/perimeters/getting-startedPerimeter/groups -H "Content-type:application/json" -H "Authorization:Bearer $token" --data "[\"Dispatcher\"]"
----

or use the provided script :
----
./putPerimeterForGroup.sh
----

The result should be a 200 Http status.

Now, if you refresh the UI or send again the card, you should see the card.

==== Card sent to a group and an entity
If a card is sent to a group and an entity, then there are 2 possibilities to receive this card :

- First possibility :
the user is both a member of this entity and a member of this group.

Let's send this card (for ENTITY1 and Dispatcher group) :
[source,JSON]
----
{
	"publisher" : "message-publisher",
	"processVersion" : "1",
	"entityRecipients" : ["ENTITY1"],
	"process"  :"defaultProcess",
	"processInstanceId" : "cardExample5_1",
	"state": "messageState2",
	"groupRecipients": ["Dispatcher"],
	"severity" : "INFORMATION",
	"startDate" : 1553186770681,
	"summary" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.summary"},
	"title" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.title"},
	"data" : {"message" : "Hello World !!! Here is a message for ENTITY1 and group Dispatcher - process/state not in operator1 perimeter "}
}
----

Use the provided script :
----
./sendCard.sh cardSentToEntityAndGroup_1.json
----

The result should be a 201 Http status, and a json object such as:

[source,JSON]
----
{"count":1,"message":"All pushedCards were successfully handled"}
----

See the result in the UI, you should see the card.


- Second possibility :
the user is a member of this entity and have the process/state of the card within its perimeter. As the perimeters are attached to groups, the user must therefore be a member of a group attached to this perimeter.

Let's send this card (for ENTITY1 and Planner group) :
[source,JSON]
----
{
	"publisher" : "message-publisher",
	"processVersion" : "1",
	"entityRecipients" : ["ENTITY1"],
	"process"  :"defaultProcess",
	"processInstanceId" : "cardExample5_2",
	"state": "messageState",
	"groupRecipients": ["Planner"],
	"severity" : "INFORMATION",
	"startDate" : 1553186770681,
	"summary" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.summary"},
	"title" : {"key" : "defaultProcess.title"},
	"data" : {"message" : "Hello World !!! Here is a message for ENTITY1 and group Planner - process/state in operator1 perimeter "}
}
----

Use the provided script :
----
./sendCard.sh cardSentToEntityAndGroup_2.json
----

The result should be a 201 Http status, and a json object such as:

[source,JSON]
----
{"count":1,"message":"All pushedCards were successfully handled"}
----

See the result in the UI, you should see the card.
