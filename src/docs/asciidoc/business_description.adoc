To perform their duties, an operator has to interact with multiple applications
(perform actions, watch for alerts, etc.), which can prove difficult if
there are too many of them.

The idea is to aggregate all the notifications from all these applications
into a single screen, and to allow the operator to act on them if needed.

These notifications are materialized by *cards* sorted in a *feed* according
to their period of relevance and their severity.
When a card is selected in the feed, the right-hand pane displays the *details*
of the card.

In addition, the cards will also translate as events displayed on a *timeline*
 at the top of the screen.

Part of the value of OperatorFabric is that it makes the integration very
simple on the part of the third-party applications.
To start publishing cards to users in an OperatorFabric instance, all they
have to do is:

* Register as a publisher through the "Businessconfig" service and provide a "bundle"
containing handlebars templates defining how cards should be rendered,
i18n info etc.
* Publish cards as json containing card data through the card publication API

OperatorFabric will then:

* Dispatch the cards to the appropriate users (by computing the actual users
who should receive the card from the recipients rules defined in the card)
* Take care of the rendering of the cards
* Display relevant information from the cards in the timeline

A card is not only information, it could be question(s) the operator has to answer.
When the operator is responding, a  card is emitted to the sender of the initial card 
and the response could be seen by other operators.

It is also possible for users to directly send card to other users using predefined card templates.

OperatorFabric user interface is running on a browser (recent version of chrome, firefox and edge are supported). 

The supported screen resolutions are : 

* Resolutions greater than or equals to 1680x1050.
* Resolutions with a width between 450-900px and a minimum height of 700px.
