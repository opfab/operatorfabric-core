To perform their duties, an operator has to interact with multiple applications
(perform actions, watch for alerts, etc.), which can prove difficult if
there are too many of them.

The idea is to aggregate all the notifications from all these applications
into a single screen, and to allow the operator to act on them if needed.

These notifications are materialized by *cards* sorted in a *feed* according
to their period of relevance and their severity.
When a card is selected in the feed, the right-hand pane displays the *details*
of the card: information about the state of the parent process instance in
the third-party application that published it, available actions, etc.

In addition, the cards will also translate as events displayed on a *timeline*
(its design is still under discussion) at the top of the screen.
This view will be complimentary to the card feed in that it will allow the
operator to see at a glance the status of processes for a given period,
when the feed is more like a "To Do" list.

Part of the value of OperatorFabric is that it makes the integration very
simple on the part of the third-party applications.
To start publishing cards to users in an OperatorFabric instance, all they
have to do is:

* Register as a publisher through the "Thirds" service and provide a "bundle"
containing handlebars templates defining how cards should be rendered,
i18n info etc.
* Publish cards as json containing card data through the card publication API

OperatorFabric will then:

* Dispatch the cards to the appropriate users (by computing the actual users
who should receive the card from the recipients rules defined in the card)
* Take care of the rendering of the cards, displaying details, actions,
inputs etc.
* Display relevant information from the cards in the timeline

Another aim of OperatorFabric is to make cooperation easier by letting
operators forward or send cards to other operators, for example:

* If they need an input from another operator
* If they can't handle a given card for lack of time or because the necessary
action is out of their scope

This will replace phone calls or emails, making cooperation more efficient
and traceable.

For instance, operators might be interested in knowing why a given decision
was made in the past:
the cards detailing the decision process steps will be accessible through
the Archives screen, showing how the
operators reached this agreement.
