= Service port table

//TODO Check that it is correct and up to date

By default all service built artifacts are configured with server.port set
to 8080

If you run the services using `bootRun` Gradle task, the `run_all.sh` script or the full docker docker-compose
(found under config/docker),
the used ports are:
