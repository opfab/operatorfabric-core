= Web UI Configuration

OperatorFabric Web UI service is built on top of a link:https://www.nginx.com/[NGINX] server.
It  serves the Angular SPA to browsers and act as a reverse proxy for other services.

== NGINX configuration

An external `nginx.conf` file configures the OperatorFabric Nginx instance named `web-ui` service.
Those files are mounted as docker volumes. There are two of them in OperatorFabric, one in `config/dev` and one in `config/docker`.

The one in `config/dev` is set with 
 permissive `CORS` rules to enable web development using `ng serve` within the `ui/main` project.It's possible to use `ng serve` with the one in `config/docker` version also. To do so use the conf file named
`nginx-cors-permissive.conf` by configuring the `/docker-compose.yml` with the following line:
----
- "./nginx-cors-permissive.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf"
----
instead of:
----
- "./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf"
----

[WARNING]
====
The line customized in the nginx configuration file must end with à semicolon (';') otherwise the Nginx server will stop immediately
====

[[ui_properties]]
== UI properties

The properties lie in the `web-ui.json`.The following table describes their meaning and  how to use them. An example file can be found in the config/docker directory.

[source, json]

|===

IMPORTANT: 
====
To declare settings parameters, you now need to group all fields under `settings: { }` 
For example: 

Replace the following invalid settings config 
```
  "settings.replayInterval": 10,
  "settings.replayEnabled": true,
  "settings": {
    "about": {
      "keycloack": {
        "name": "Keycloak",
        "rank": 2,
        "version": "6.0.1"
      },
    }
    "locale": "en",
    "dateTimeFormat": "HH:mm DD/MM/YYYY",
    "dateFormat": "DD/MM/YYYY",
    "styleWhenNightDayModeDesactivated": "NIGHT"
  },
```

By this valid one : 

```
  "settings": {
    "replayInterval": 10,
    "replayEnabled": true,
    "about": {
      "keycloack": {
        "name": "Keycloak",
        "rank": 2,
        "version": "6.0.1"
      },
    }
    "locale": "en",
    "dateTimeFormat": "HH:mm DD/MM/YYYY",
    "dateFormat": "DD/MM/YYYY",
    "styleWhenNightDayModeDesactivated": "NIGHT"
  },
```
