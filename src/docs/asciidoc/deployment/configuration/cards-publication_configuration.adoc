= Cards-Publication Business service

OperatorFabric Cards-Publication Business service is a Spring Webflux application
bootstrapped using SpringBoot.

In our spring micro service architecture this service depends on Eureka
Registry.

== Mandatory configuration, Profiles and default properties

The service has no mandatory configuration beside global configuration and
usual bootstrap configuration.

For other configuration see:

* {springboot_doc}/reference/htmlsingle/[Spring Boot documentation].
* {spring_doc}spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux[Spring MVC documentation].

=== Service specific properties


|===
|name|default|mandatory?|Description

|operatorfabric.card-write.window.size|1000|no|card input window size to fill before flush
|operatorfabric.card-write.window.timeout|500|no|card input window millis wait time before flush
|operatorfabric.card-notification.window.size|100|no|card notification window size to fill before flush
|operatorfabric.card-notification.window.timeout|1000|no|card notification window millis wait time before flush

=== default properties

Note that you must provide a bootstrap file with a convenient registry configuration

_bootstrap.yml_

[source]
----
include::examples/cards-publication/bootstrap.yml[]
----

_bootstrap-docker.yml_

[source]
----
include::examples/cards-publication/bootstrap-docker.yml[]
----

_bootstrap-dev.yml_

[source]
----
include::examples/cards-publication/bootstrap-dev.yml[]
----

The bootstrap-docker.yml file is a replacement bootstrap file we use for our
docker images configuration.

The bootstrap-dev.yml file is a replacement bootstrap file we use for our
development environment

The above embedded configurations are the basic settings of the application:

* it sets its service name
* it sets the configuration name to use (which configuration file to retrieve)
* it must set the registry service (example in bootstrap-docker.yml)

== Specifying external configuration properties when launching a jar file

See {springboot_doc}/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files[Application Property Files]
on how to setup an external spring properties or yml file.

See {springboot_doc}/reference/htmlsingle/#howto-set-active-spring-profiles[Set the Active Spring Profiles] for specifying alternate profile.


== Specifying configuration properties when launching a docker image

Our docker image expects optional property file to be stored in the container
/service-config folder. You can bind so docker volume to this path to make
properties or yml available.

At time of writing, you cannot specify an alternate profile at runCards-Publication.
The default profiles activated are docker and native.

=== Available environment variables for docker image

* REGISTRY_HOST: Registry service host
* REGISTRY_PORT: Registry service port
* JAVA_OPTIONS: Additional java options
