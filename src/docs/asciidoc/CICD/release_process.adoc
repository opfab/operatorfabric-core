= Release process

[[version_numbers]]
== Version numbers

Version numbers X.Y.Z.label should be understood like this:

* X: Major version, a major version adds new features and breaks compatibility with previous major and minor versions.
* Y: Minor version, a minor version adds new features and does not break compatibility with previous minor versions for
the same major version.
* Z: Patch, a patch version only contains bug fixes of current minor version
* Label: pre-release or build metadata:
** SNAPSHOT: a version whose development is in progress, nightly builds only deliver SNAPSHOT versions
** RELEASE: a version whose development is finished

== Releasing Version

IMPORTANT: To release a version we use some Travis dedicated jobs. These jobs are triggered by specific commit keywords and rely
on the VERSION file at the root of this repository to know which version is being produced.
It is thus crucial to double-check the content of this file before any push (triggering the Travis jobs) is made.

Before releasing a version, you need to prepare the release.

Considering a version X.X.X.SNAPSHOT.

=== Check the release notes

. Click the appropriate version from
https://opfab.atlassian.net/projects/OC?orderField=RANK&selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&status=all[JIRA the release list]
to get the release notes (click "Release notes" under the version name at the top) listing new features, fixed bugs etc...
+
image::release_notes.png[Release notes link]
. Make sure that the
link:https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/blob/master/src/docs/asciidoc/docs/release_notes.adoc[release_notes.adoc]
file lists all the issues, bugs, tags or feature requests that are relevant for OperatorFabric users along with
explanations if need be.

=== In the source repository (operatorfabric-core)

. Use the ./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh script to automatically perform all the necessary changes:
+
```
./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh
```
+
This will perform the following changes:
+
* Replace X.X.X.SNAPSHOT with X.X.X.RELEASE in swagger.yaml files and the VERSION file at the root operator-fabric folder
* Change the version from W.W.W.RELEASE (previous release) to X.X.X.RELEASE in the deploy docker-compose file
+
IMPORTANT: The VERSION file is particularly important as the CI/CD pipeline tasks
(building the documentation and the docker images for example) are based on it.

. Commit with the template message:
+
```
[RELEASE] X.X.X.RELEASE (ci_docker,ci_documentation)
```
+
The commit comment leverages these three keywords to trigger the delivery of documentation and docker images, so you should
check that they are correctly spelt.

* ci_docker: triggers the build and upload of versioned docker images to DockerHub
* ci_documentation: triggers the build and upload of the current documentation

. Tag the commit with the version
+
```
git tag X.X.X.RELEASE
```

. Push the commit
+
```
git push
```

. Push the tag
+
```
git push origin X.X.X.RELEASE
```

. Check that the build is correctly triggered
+
You can check the status of the build job triggered by the commit on
link:https://travis-ci.org/opfab/operatorfabric-core/branches[Travis CI].
The build job should have the following three stages:
+
image::running_build.png[Running build status page screenshot]
+
Wait for the build to complete (around 30 minutes).

. Check that the X.X.X.RELEASE images have been generated and pushed to DockerHub.

. Check that the latest images have been updated on DockerHub.

. Check that the documentation has been generated and pushed to the GitHub pages website
.. Check the version and revision date at the top of the documents in the current documentation
(for example link:https://opfab.github.io/documentation/current/architecture/[the architecture documentation])
.. Check that you see the X.X.X.RELEASE under the link:https://opfab.github.io/pages/releases.html[releases page]
and that the links work.

. Check that the tag was correctly pushed to GitHub and is visible under the
https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/releases[releases page] for the repository.

=== Checking deploy docker-compose

The deploy docker-compose file should always rely on the latest RELEASE version
available on DockerHub. Once the CI pipeline triggered by the previous steps has completed successfully,
and you can see X.X.X.RELEASE images for all services on DockerHub, you should:

. Remove your locally built X.X.X.RELEASE images if any
. Run the deploy docker-compose file to make sure it pulls the images from DockerHub and behaves as intended.

=== In Jira

. Set all concerned tickets (US, BUG, FR) and set fix version to X.X.X.RELEASE

. In the "Releases" screen release X.X.X.RELEASE version

== Advertising the new release on the LFE mailing list

. Take the text from the release note and use it to send an email to the opfab-announce@lists.lfenergy.org mailing list.

== Preparing next version

IMPORTANT: You should wait for all the tasks associated with creating the X.X.X.RELEASE
version to finish and make sure that they've had the expected output before starting the
preparation of the next version. This is because any committed/pushed changes preparing the
new version will make rolling back or correcting any mistake on the release more complicated.

To prepare a next version you simply need to increment the version after a release (see
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<version_numbers, Version numbers>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/CICD/index.adoc#version_numbers, Version numbers>>]
).

=== In the source repository (operatorfabric-core)

. Use the ./CICD/prepare_snapshot_version.sh script to automatically perform all the necessary changes:
+
```
./CICD/prepare_snapshot_version.sh --version Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT
```
+
This will perform the following changes:
+
* Replace all occurrences of X.X.X.RELEASE by Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT **EXCEPT** in the deploy docker-compose file
(src/main/docker/deploy/docker-compose.yml). The files concerned are swagger.yaml files and the VERSION file at
the root operatorfabric-core folder.
+
IMPORTANT: The VERSION file is particularly important as the CI/CD pipeline tasks
(building the documentation and the docker images for example) are based on it.
+
NOTE: If no --version parameter is provided to the script, the new version will be the next minor version.
+
. Modify the
link:https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/blob/master/src/docs/asciidoc/docs/release_notes.adoc[release_notes.adoc]
file to initialize the release notes for version Y.Y.Y.RELEASE.
. Commit and push changes with the following message:
+
```
[PREPARE] next version: Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT (ci_docker,ci_documentation)
```

Wait for the build to complete (around 30 minutes).

. Check that the snapshot images have been generated and pushed to DockerHub.

. Check that the documentation has been generated and pushed to the GitHub pages website: you should see the
Y.Y.Y.SNAPSHOT under the link:https://opfab.github.io/pages/releases.html[releases page]. Check that the links work.

=== In Jira

. In the "Releases" screen create a  Y.Y.Y.RELEASE version.
