= Release process

== Version numbers

We work with two types of versions:

* X.Y.Z.RELEASE versions are stable versions
* SNAPSHOT version represents the current state of merged developments

Version numbers for X.Y.Z.RELEASE should be understood like this:

* X: Major version, a major version adds new features and breaks compatibility with previous major and minor versions.
* Y: Minor version, a minor version adds new features and does not break compatibility with previous minor versions for
the same major version.
* Z: Patch, a patch version only contains bug fixes of current minor version

== Releasing a Major or Minor Version

IMPORTANT: To release a version we use some Travis dedicated jobs. These jobs are triggered by specific commit keywords
and rely on the VERSION file at the root of this repository to know which version is being produced.
It is thus crucial to double-check the content of this file before any push (triggering the Travis jobs) is made.

Before releasing a version, you need to prepare the release.

=== Checking the release notes

. Click the `Next Release` from
link:{jira_release_page}[JIRA the release list]
to get the release notes (click "Release notes" under the version name at the top) listing new features, fixed bugs etc...
+
image::release_notes.png[Release notes link]
. Make sure that the
link:https://github.com/opfab/release-notes/blob/master/release_notes.adoc[release_notes.adoc]
file lists all the issues, bugs, tags or feature requests that are relevant for OperatorFabric users along with
explanations if need be.

. Based on the content of this version and the rules listed above, determine the version number for next version.

=== Creating a release branch and preparing the release

. On the link:{opfab_core_repo}[operatorfabric-core repository], create a branch off the `develop` branch named
`X.X.X.release` (note the lowercase `release` to distinguish it from `X.X.X.RELEASE` tags).
+
----
git checkout -b X.X.X.release
----

. Cut the contents from the release_notes.adoc file from the
link:https://github.com/opfab/release-notes/[release-notes repository] and paste it to the release_notes.adoc file
found under *src/docs/asciidoc/docs* in the link:{opfab_core_repo}[operatorfabric-core repository].

. In the link:{opfab_core_repo}[operatorfabric-core repository] release-notes.adoc file, replace the `Version SNAPSHOT`
title by `Version X.X.X.RELEASE`

. In the link:{jira_release_page}[releases page on JIRA], change the name from "Next Version" to "X.X.X.RELEASE"

. Use the ./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh script to automatically perform all the necessary changes:
+
----
./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh -v X.X.X.RELEASE
----
+
You should get the following output:
+
----
Current version is SNAPSHOT (based on VERSION file)
Preparing X.X.X.RELEASE
Updating version for pipeline in VERSION file
Replacing SNAPSHOT with X.X.X.RELEASE in swagger.yaml files
Using X.X.X.RELEASE for lfeoperatorfabric images in dev and docker environment docker-compose files
The following files have been updated:
 M VERSION
 M config/dev/docker-compose.yml
 M config/docker/docker-compose.yml
 M services/core/cards-publication/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml
 M services/core/businessconfig/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml
 M services/core/users/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml
----
+
This script performs the following changes:
+
* Replace SNAPSHOT with X.X.X.RELEASE in swagger.yaml files and the VERSION file at the root operator-fabric folder
* Change the version from SNAPSHOT to X.X.X.RELEASE in the docker-compose files for dev and docker deployments
+
. Commit the changes with the template message:
+
----
git add .
git commit -m "[RELEASE] X.X.X.RELEASE"
----
+
. Push the commit
+
----
git push --set-upstream origin X.X.X.release
----

. Check that the build is correctly triggered
+
You can check the status of the build job triggered by the commit on
link:https://travis-ci.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/branches[Travis CI].
The build job should have the following three stages:
+
image::release_branch_build.png[Running build for release branch screenshot]
+
Wait for the build to complete (around 20 minutes) and check that all stages have been successful.
This ensures that the code builds, tests are OK and there is no error preventing documentation or Docker images
generation.

=== Merging the release branch into `master`

Once the release branch build is passing, you should merge the release branch into `master` to bring the new
developments into `master` and trigger the CICD tasks associated with a release (Docker images for DockerHub and
documentation).

----
git checkout master <1>
git pull <2>
git merge X.X.X.release <3>
----
<1> Check out the `master` branch
<2> Make sure your local copy is up to date
<3> Merge the `X.X.X.release` branch into `master`, accepting changes from X.X.X.release in case of conflicts.

NOTE: Specific keywords such as "ci_docker" etc. are no longer required in the case of a release on master as
by design any release on master becomes the "latest" version, so docker images generation (both for the version
tag and the latest tag) and documentation update (both for the release and the "current" folder) should always
be triggered.

----
git tag X.X.X.RELEASE <1>
git push <2>
git push origin X.X.X.RELEASE <3>
----
<1> Tag the commit with the `X.X.X.RELEASE` tag
<2> Push the commits to update the remote `master` branch
<3> Push the tag

. Check that the build is correctly triggered
+
You can check the status of the build job triggered by the commit on
link:https://travis-ci.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/branches[Travis CI].
The build job should have the following four stages (or three if the images aren't tagged as latest)
+
image::master_branch_build.png[Running build for master branch screenshot]
+
Wait for the build to complete (around 20 minutes) and check that all stages have been successful.

. Check that the `X.X.X.RELEASE` images have been generated and pushed to DockerHub.

. Check that the `latest` images have been updated on DockerHub (if this has been triggered).

. Check that the documentation has been generated and pushed to the GitHub pages website
.. Check the version and revision date at the top of the documents in the current documentation
(for example link:https://opfab.github.io/documentation/current/architecture/[the architecture documentation])
.. Check that you see the X.X.X.RELEASE under the link:https://opfab.github.io/pages/releases.html[releases page]
and that the links work.

. Check that the tag was correctly pushed to GitHub and is visible under the
https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/releases[releases page] for the repository.

=== Checking the docker-compose files

While the docker-compose files should always point to the SNAPSHOT images while on the `develop` branch, on the `master`
branch they should rely on the latest RELEASE version available on DockerHub. Once the CI pipeline triggered by the
previous steps has completed successfully, and you can see X.X.X.RELEASE images for all services on DockerHub, you should:

. Remove your locally built X.X.X.RELEASE images if any
. Run the config/docker docker-compose file to make sure it pulls the images from DockerHub and behaves as intended.

People who want to experiment with OperatorFabric are pointed to this docker-compose so it's important to make sure
that it's working correctly.

=== In Jira

In the "Releases" screen, release `X.X.X.RELEASE`.

=== Advertising the new release on the LFE mailing list

. Send an email to the opfab-announce@lists.lfenergy.org mailing list with a link to the release notes on the website.

NOTE: Here is the link to the link:https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/main[administration website for the LFE mailing lists]
in case there is an issue.

=== Preparing the next version

IMPORTANT: You should wait for all the tasks associated with creating the X.X.X.RELEASE
version to finish and make sure that they've had the expected output before starting the
preparation of the next version. This is because any committed/pushed changes preparing the
new version will make rolling back or correcting any mistake on the release more complicated.

==== In Jira

In the "Releases" screen create a new release called `Next Release`.

==== On the release-notes repository

Remove the items listed in the release_notes.adoc file so it's ready for the next version.

==== On the operatorfabric-core repository

Now that the release branch has served its purpose, it should be deleted so as not to clutter the repository and to
avoid confusion with the actual release commit tagged on `master`.

----
git branch -d X.X.X.release <1>
----
<1> Delete the branch locally

NOTE: The branch will automatically be deleted from GitHub after it is merged (new repository policy).

== Releasing a Patch (Hotfixes) Version

Let's say fixes are needed on version X.X.0.RELEASE, and will be released as X.X.X.RELEASE. If it's the first patch 
version to be released for this minor version (i.e. version X.X.1.RELEASE), you will need to create the `X.X.hotfixes` 
branch.
To do so:

[source,bash]
----
git checkout X.X.0.RELEASE <1>
git checkout -b X.X.hotfixes <2>
----
<1> Checkout X.X.0.RELEASE tag
<2> Create (and checkout) branch `X.X.hotfixes` from this commit

If branch `X.X.hotfixes` already exists, you can just check it out.

[source,bash]
----
git checkout X.X.hotfixes
----

You also need to create the corresponding release on JIRA so it can be defined as "Fix version" once the fixes are 
completed.

Then, follow the process described
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<working_on_hotfix, here>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/community/index.adoc#working_on_hotfix, here>>] to
create feature branches, work on fixes and merge them back into `X.X.hotfixes`.

Once all the big fixes that need to go into the version X.X.X.RELEASE have been merged into branch `X.X.hotfix`, you
can release the patch version. To do so:

. Write a release notes detailing the bug fixes in the release_notes.adoc file found under 
*src/docs/asciidoc/docs* in the link:{opfab_core_repo}[operatorfabric-core repository].

. Make sure all the issues that have been fixed have "X.X.X.RELEASE" as their "Fix Version" on JIRA.

. Use the ./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh script to automatically perform all the necessary changes:
+
----
./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh -v X.X.X.RELEASE
----
+
. Commit the changes, tag them and push both to GitHub:
+
----
git add .
git commit -m "[RELEASE] X.X.X.RELEASE ci_docker ci_documentation" <1>
git tag X.X.X.RELEASE <2>
git push <3>
git push origin X.X.X.RELEASE <4>
----
<1> Commit the changes
<2> Tag the release
<3> Push the commit
<4> Push the tag

IMPORTANT: In the case of a patch on the last major/minor version tagged on master, this version will become the
`latest` version. In this case, add `ci_latest` instead of `ci_docker ci_documentation` to the commit message
to also update the `latest` docker images on DockerHub and the `current` documentation on the website.
