[[release_process]]
= Release process

== Version numbers

We work with three types of versions:

* X.Y.Z.RELEASE versions are stable versions
* X.Y.Z-RC.RELEASE versions are release candidates for the next stable version
* SNAPSHOT version represents the current state of merged developments

Version numbers for X.Y.Z.RELEASE should be understood like this:

* X: Major version, a major version adds new features and breaks compatibility with previous major and minor versions.
* Y: Minor version, a minor version adds new features and does not break compatibility with previous minor versions for
the same major version.
* Z: Patch, a patch version only contains bug fixes of current minor version

== Releasing a Release Candidate 

Before releasing a version, you need to prepare the release.

=== Creating a release branch and preparing the release candidate

. On the link:{opfab_core_repo}[operatorfabric-core repository], create a branch off the `develop` branch named
`X.X.release` if it does not exist  (note the lowercase `release` to distinguish it from `X.X.X.RELEASE` tags).
+
----
git checkout -b X.X.release
git push --set-upstream origin X.X.release
----
+
Create a working branch for the release candidate. This branch will be used to prepare the release candidate :
+
----
git checkout -b FE-X.X.X-RC.release.draft
----
+
. Use the ./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh script to automatically perform all the necessary changes:
+
----
./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh -v X.X.X-RC.RELEASE
----
+
You should get the following output:
+
----
Current version is SNAPSHOT (based on VERSION file)
Preparing X.X.X-RC.RELEASE
Updating version for pipeline in VERSION file
Replacing SNAPSHOT with X.X.X-RC.RELEASE in swagger.yaml files
Using X.X.X-RC.RELEASE for lfeoperatorfabric images in dev and docker environment docker compose files
The following files have been updated:
 M VERSION
 M config/dev/docker-compose.yml
 M config/docker/docker-compose.yml
 M services/cards-publication/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml
 M services/businessconfig/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml
 M services/users/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml
----
+
This script performs the following changes:
+
* Replace SNAPSHOT with X.X.X-RC.RELEASE in swagger.yaml files and the VERSION file at the root operator-fabric folder
* Change the version from SNAPSHOT to X.X.X-RC.RELEASE in the docker compose files for dev and docker deployments
+
. Commit the changes with the template message:
+
----
git add .
git commit -s -m "[RELEASE] X.X.X-RC.RELEASE"
----
+
. Push the commit
+
----
git push --set-upstream origin FE-X.X.X-RC.release.draft
----
+
. Create a pull request from the `FE-X.X.X-RC.release.draft` branch to the `X.X.release` branch and ask for a review.
+
. Once the pull request is approved and merge, create the tag for the release candidate:
+
----
git checkout X.X.release
git pull  
git tag X.X.X-RC.RELEASE
git push origin X.X.X-RC.RELEASE
----

=== Publish the release candidate on docker hub and documentation

If the build and tests are successful, launch manually GitHubActions with jobs : `Build` , `Docker Push` and `Build and publish documentation` 

[[publishing_client_lib_release]]
=== Publishing the jars for the client library to Maven Central

Once everything else looks ok, you can publish the jars for the client library to MavenCentral. This is done as a last
step once we are pretty sure we won't need to go back and change things on the release because jars are not meant to be
removed from Maven Central once they are published (even briefly), and it's not something that could be managed by the
project.

To do so:

. Set the appropriate properties (credentials and GPG key information) as described in the
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<client_lib_pub_conf, documentation for the publishing task>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/dev_env/index.adoc#client_lib_pub_conf, documentation for the publishing task>>]

. Run the following command from the project root on the release branch:
+
----
./gradlew publish
----
+
. After a while you should be prompted to enter the passphrase for the GPG key.

. Once the task has completed, log in to the https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/[OSSRH Repository] using the same credentials
as for the Sonatype JIRA.
+
image::ossrh_repo_welcome.png[Welcome page for the OSSRH repository manager]

. Click on `Staging repositories` link on the left. After a while (and maybe after clicking the refresh button), you
should see a repository with the name orgopfab-XXXX (where XXXX is a Sonatype-generated id, not related to the
release number).
+
image::ossrh_staging_repos.png[Staging repositories]

. Click on the repository then on the "content" tab below to check its content and metadata.
+
image::check_staging_repo.png[Check staging repository]

. If there is an issue with the repository, click on the "Drop" button and start the process again after making the
necessary changes. If everything looks in order, click on the "Close" button and add a small comment when prompted to
confirm.
+
image::close_staging_repo.png[Close staging repository]

. This will trigger validation of the https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/[Sonatype requirements] (for
example, making sure that the pom file contains the required information), as you can see from the Activity tab below
(Refresh might be needed).
+
image::closing_and_validation_of_repo.png[Closing and validation of the staging repository]

. If all the validations pass, the "Release" button will become available. Click it to send the jars to Maven Central.
When prompted, write a comment then confirm (keeping the "Automatically Drop" option checked).
+
image::confirm_release_to_maven_central.png[Release to Maven Central]

. The jars for the release should then be available on the https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/opfab/[project space in the Maven repository] within 10 minutes.

. It can take up to two hours for them to appear on the https://search.maven.org/search?q=opfab[Maven Central Repository Search] and up to one day for https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.opfab[MvnRepository]

=== Publishing the release on GitHub

. On the https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/releases[`releases` screen] for the core repository, draft a new
release.
.. Select the existing X.X.X-RC.RELEASE tag
.. The title should be X.X.X-RC.RELEASE
.. In the description field, paste the content from the release_notes_X.X.X.md file from the
link:https://github.com/opfab/release-notes/[release-notes repository].
.. Reformat and correct the content as needed.
.. Check if there is a migration guide for this version, if so, check if the corresponding file has been included in
src/docs/asciidoc/resources/index.adoc and include a link to it at the top of the release notes.
.. Click "Publish release"

. Create a new release_notes.Y.Y.Y.md file with next version number.

=== Updating the version list on the website

On the link:{opfab_website_repo}[website repository],
edit the link:{opfab_website_repo}/blob/master/_data/versions.yml[/_data/versions.yml] file to add the version being released 

For example:

.Before
[source,yaml]
----
- id: SNAPSHOT
  type: SNAPSHOT
  external_devices_api: true
- id: D.E.F.RELEASE
  badge: current
  external_devices_api: true
- id: A.B.C.RELEASE
  #... end of file omitted
----

.After
[source,yaml]
----
- id: SNAPSHOT
  type: SNAPSHOT
  external_devices_api: true
- id: X.X.X-RC.RELEASE
  external_devices_api: true
- id: D.E.F.RELEASE
  external_devices_api: true
  badge: current
- id: A.B.C.RELEASE
  #... end of file omitted
----

This file determines which versions (and in which order) are displayed on the
link:https://opfab.github.io/pages/releases.html[release page] of the website.

Check that you see the X.X.X-RC.RELEASE under the link:https://opfab.github.io/pages/releases.html[releases page]
and that the links work (It may need a few minutes for the website to be updated).

NOTE: The `external_devices_api` property should be set to true for all new versions, so the API documentation for
the External Devices API is displayed on the website.


=== Advertising the new release 

* Advertising on the LFE mailing list via an email to the opfab-announce@lists.lfenergy.org mailing list with a link to the release notes on GitHub.

NOTE: Here is the link to the link:https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/main[administration website for the LFE mailing lists]
in case there is an issue.

* Send a message on operator-fabric slack channel.


== Releasing a Major or Minor Version

Before releasing a version, you need to prepare the release.

=== Move Release Candidate to Release

. Create a branch to prepare the release from the release candidate branch:
+
----
git checkout X.X.release
git checkout -b X.X.X.release.draft
----
+
. Use the ./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh script to automatically perform all the necessary changes:
+
----
./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh -v X.X.X.RELEASE
----
+
You should get the following output:
+
----
Current version is SNAPSHOT (based on VERSION file)
Preparing X.X.X.RELEASE
Updating version for pipeline in VERSION file
Replacing SNAPSHOT with X.X.X.RELEASE in swagger.yaml files
Using X.X.X.RELEASE for lfeoperatorfabric images in dev and docker environment docker compose files
The following files have been updated:
 M VERSION
 M config/dev/docker-compose.yml
 M config/docker/docker-compose.yml
 M services/cards-publication/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml
 M services/businessconfig/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml
 M services/users/src/main/modeling/swagger.yaml
----
+
This script performs the following changes:
+
* Replace SNAPSHOT with X.X.X.RELEASE in swagger.yaml files and the VERSION file at the root operator-fabric folder
* Change the version from SNAPSHOT to X.X.X.RELEASE in the docker compose files for dev and docker deployments
+
. Commit the changes with the template message:
+
----
git add .
git commit -s -m "[RELEASE] X.X.X.RELEASE"
----
+
. Push the commit
+
----
git push --set-upstream origin X.X.X.release.draft
----
+
. Create a pull request from the 'X.X.X.release.draft` branch to the `X.X.release` branch and ask for a review.
+
. Once the pull request is approved and merge, create the tag for the release candidate:
+
----
git checkout X.X.release
git pull  
git tag X.X.X.RELEASE
git push origin X.X.X.RELEASE
----

[[publish_release_on_docker_hub_and_documentation]]
=== Publish the release on docker hub and documentation

Once the release branch build is passing, you should trigger the CICD tasks associated with a release (Docker images for DockerHub and
documentation).

To do so , go to 
link:https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/actions[Github Actions].
and launch the workflow on X.X.release branch with the following options :
- Build : true 
- Karate tests : false
- Cypress tests : false 
- Build and publish documentation : true
- Build and publish documentation - Latest : true if it is the last major/minor version
- Docker Push : true
- Docker Push - Latest : true if it is the last major/minor version


Wait for the build to complete and check that all jobs have been successful.

. Check that the `X.X.X.RELEASE` images have been generated and pushed to DockerHub.

. Check that the `latest` images have been updated on DockerHub (if this has been triggered).

. Check that the documentation has been generated and pushed to the GitHub pages website : check the version and revision date at the top of the documents in the current documentation
(for example link:https://opfab.github.io/documentation/current/architecture/[the architecture documentation])


. Check that the tag was correctly pushed to GitHub and is visible under the
https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/tags[tags page] for the repository.

[[update_version_list_on_website]]
=== Updating the version list on the website

On the link:{opfab_website_repo}[website repository],
edit the link:{opfab_website_repo}/blob/master/_data/versions.yml[/_data/versions.yml] file to:

. Add the version being released to the list with the `current` badge
. Remove the `current` badge from the previous version

For example:

.Before
[source,yaml]
----
- id: SNAPSHOT
  type: SNAPSHOT
  external_devices_api: true
- id: D.E.F.RELEASE
  badge: current
  external_devices_api: true
- id: A.B.C.RELEASE
  #... end of file omitted
----

.After
[source,yaml]
----
- id: SNAPSHOT
  type: SNAPSHOT
  external_devices_api: true
- id: X.X.X.RELEASE
  badge: current
  external_devices_api: true
- id: D.E.F.RELEASE
  external_devices_api: true
- id: A.B.C.RELEASE
  #... end of file omitted
----

This file determines which versions (and in which order) are displayed on the
link:https://opfab.github.io/pages/releases.html[release page] of the website.

Check that you see the X.X.X.RELEASE under the link:https://opfab.github.io/pages/releases.html[releases page]
and that the links work (It may need a few minutes for the website to be updated).

NOTE: The `external_devices_api` property should be set to true for all new versions, so the API documentation for
the External Devices API is displayed on the website.

[[checking_docker_compose]]
=== Checking the docker compose files

While the docker compose files should always point to the SNAPSHOT images while on the `develop` branch, on the `X.X.release`
branch they should rely on the latest RELEASE version available on DockerHub. Once the CI pipeline triggered by the
previous steps has completed successfully, and you can see X.X.X.RELEASE images for all services on DockerHub, you should:

. Remove your locally built X.X.X.RELEASE images if any
. Run the config/docker docker compose file to make sure it pulls the images from DockerHub and behaves as intended.

People who want to experiment with OperatorFabric are pointed to this docker compose so it's important to make sure
that it's working correctly.

=== Publishing the jars for the client library to Maven Central

Like for release candidate , you need to <<publishing_client_lib_release, release the client library jars>>.


[[publishing_release_on_github]]
=== Publishing the release on GitHub

. On the https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/releases[`releases` screen] for the core repository, draft a new
release.
.. Select the existing X.X.X.RELEASE tag
.. The title should be X.X.X.RELEASE
.. In the description field, paste the content from the release_notes_X.X.X.md file from the
link:https://github.com/opfab/release-notes/[release-notes repository].
.. Reformat and correct the content as needed.
.. Check if there is a migration guide for this version, if so, check if the corresponding file has been included in
src/docs/asciidoc/resources/index.adoc and include a link to it at the top of the release notes.
.. Click "Publish release"


[[supported_versions]]
=== Update supported versions

Update supported version in security policy (SECURITY.md file) via a Pull Request on develop branch 


[[advertising_new_release]]
=== Advertising the new release 

* Advertising on the LFE mailing list via an email to the opfab-announce@lists.lfenergy.org mailing list with a link to the release notes on GitHub.

NOTE: Here is the link to the link:https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/main[administration website for the LFE mailing lists]
in case there is an issue.

* Send a message on operator-fabric slack channel.

=== Preparing the next version

Remove the release_notes.X.X.X.md file corresponding to the release's version.


== Releasing a Patch Version

Let's say fixes that will be released as X.X.X.RELEASE. 

Follow the process described
ifdef::single-page-doc[<<working_on_fix, here>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<</documentation/current/community/index.adoc#working_on_fix, here>>]
to create feature branches, work on fixes and merge them back into `X.X.release`.


Once all the big fixes that need to go into the version X.X.X.RELEASE have been merged into branch `X.X.release`, you
can release the patch version. To do so:

Create a branch to prepare the release from the release branch:

[source,bash]
----
git pull X.X.release
git checkout X.X.release
git checkout -b X.X.X.release.draft
----


. Use the ./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh script to automatically perform all the necessary changes:
+
----
./CICD/prepare_release_version.sh -v X.X.X.RELEASE
----
+
. Commit the changes and push to GitHub:
+
----
git add .
git commit -m "[RELEASE] X.X.X.RELEASE "
git push --set-upstream origin X.X.X.release.draft 

----
+
. Create a pull request from the 'X.X.X.release.draft` branch to the `X.X.release` branch and ask for a review.
+
. Once the pull request is approved and merge, create the tag for the release candidate:
+
----
git checkout X.X.release
git pull  
git tag X.X.X.RELEASE
git push origin X.X.X.RELEASE
----


You then have to follow the following steps as for a classic release:

* <<publish_release_on_docker_hub_and_documentation, Publish the release on docker hub and documentation>>
* <<update_version_list_on_website, Updating the version list on the website>>.
* <<checking_docker_compose, Checking the docker compose files>>.
* <<publishing_release_on_github, Publishing the release on GitHub>>.
* <<publishing_client_lib_release, Release the client library jars>>.
* <<supported_versions, Update supported versions>>.
* <<advertising_new_release, Advertising the new release>>.
