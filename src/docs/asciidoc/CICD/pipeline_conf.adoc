= Pipeline Configuration

The first part briefly describes the organization of the real CICD pipeline whereas the second part lists the steps
that were necessary to create the mock pipeline as well as the issues we ran into.

Most of the access and permissions required by our CICD plateform (Travis) are managed by tokens that are created on
each of the required services (SonarCloud, DockerHub, GitHub).
A technical user account (opfabtech) has been created for each of these services so that these tokens are not linked
to the account of any member of the team.

== CICD Pipeline

=== Travis CI

We use Travis CI to manage our pipeline. As of today, it is composed of 3 stages:
[horizontal]
test-assemble:: Run on every push regardless of the branch, does the build and produces test reports.
It also triggers a sonar-scanner analysis and pushes the results to SonarCloud (except for external pull requests).
doc:: Run only on the master branch, for the daily cron jobs or if a commit is push with a message containing
ci_documentation. It generates the documentation (adoc, javadoc, compodoc, reports) and pushes it to the opfab.github.io
repository to update the website.
docker:: Run only on the master branch, for the daily cron jobs or if a commit is push with a message containing
ci_docker. It generates the docker images for the current version and pushes them to DockerHub.

=== SonarCloud

To be allowed to push results to SonarCloud, Travis needs to be authenticated. This is done by generating a token on
SonarCloud with an account (opfabtech) that has admin rights to the organization, and then providing this token to Travis
either through the .travis.yml file or as an environment variable through Travis settings
(see <<_sonarcloud_2,SonarCloud>> below).

=== GitHub (documentation)

To be allowed to push the generated documentation to the opfab.github.io, Travis needs write access to the repository.
This is done by setting up a Personal Access Token in GitHub using the technical account
(see <<_github_documentation_2,GitHub (documentation)>> below).
This token is then passed to Travis as an environment variable through Travis settings, and is used in the .travis.yml file.
Right now the scope of this token is maximal, it can probably be reduced (see https://opfab.atlassian.net/browse/OC-755[OC-755]).

NOTE: After new content is pushed to the opfab.github.io repository, it can take a few minutes before this content is
visible on the website because it needs to be built by GitHub pages, and this can take a short while
depending on how busy the service is.

=== DockerHub
To be allowed to push images to DockerHub, Travis needs to be authenticated. This is done by setting the dockerhub
login and password of the technical account as environment variables through Travis settings and referencing them in
the .travis.yml file (see <<_dockerhub_2,DockerHub>> below).

== Mock CICD Pipeline

We wanted to be able to test changes to this configuration or to the scripts used by the pipeline without risks to the real
master branch, to our docker images or to the documentation. We didn't find any such "dry-run" options on Travis CI so
we decided to create a complete mock pipeline replicating the actual pipeline.
This is a short summary of the necessary steps.

=== GitHub
. Create organization opfab-mock
. Create user account opfabtechmock
. Invite opfabtechmock to opfab-mock organization as owner (see later if this can/should be restricted)
. Fork operatorfabric-core and opfab.github.io repos to opfab-mock organization

=== Travis CI
. Go to travis-ci.org (not travis-ci.com)
. Sign in with GitHub (using opfabtechmock)
This redirects to a page offering to grant access to your account to Travis CI for Open Source, click ok.
+
Note: This page (https://github.com/settings/applications) lets you review the apps that have keen granted this kind
of access and when it was last used.

. Looking at https://travis-ci.org/account/repositories, the opfab-mock organization didn't appear even after syncing
the account, so click on "review and add your authorized organizations" (this redirects to
https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/f244293c729d5066cf27).

. Click "grant" next to the organization.

. After that, Travis CI for Open Source is visible here: https://github.com/organizations/opfab-mock/settings/oauth_application_policy.
+
This allowed the opfab-mock organization to appear in the account: https://travis-ci.org/account/repositories
Click on opfab-mock to get to the https://travis-ci.org/organizations/opfab-mock/repositories[list of repositories for this organization] and toggle "operatorfabric-core" on.
+
image::travis-ci.png[]
+
. Under the https://travis-ci.org/opfab-mock/operatorfabric-core/settings[Travis settings for the operatorfabric-core repository],
create a Cron Job on branch master, that runs daily and is always run.

=== SonarCloud

. Go to SonarCloud.io
. Sign in with GitHub
+
IMPORTANT: When switching between accounts (your own and the technical account for example), make sure to log out of
SonarCloud when you're done using an account because otherwise it will keep the existing session (even in a new tab)
rather than sign you back in with the account you're currently using on GitHub.
+
. Authorize SonarCloud by sonarcloud
+ Create a new organization
https://sonarcloud.io/create-organization[from the "+" dropdown menu to the left of your profile picture]
+
IMPORTANT: Click on "Just testing? You can create manually" on the bottom right, and not "Choose an organization on GitHub".
+
This is because the "opfab" SonarCloud organization that we are trying to replicate is not currently linked to its GitHub
counterpart (maybe the option didn't exist at the time), so we're doing the same here. In the future it might be a good
idea to link them (see https://opfab.atlassian.net/browse/OC-751[OC-751])as SonarCloud states that
____
Binding an organization from SonarCloud with GitHub is an easy way to keep
them synchronized. To bind this organization to GitHub, the SonarCloud application will be installed.
____
And then it warns again that
____
Manual setup is not recommended, and leads to missing features like appropriate setup of
your project or analysis feedback in the Pull Request.
____
. Click "Analyze new project" then "Create manually" (for the same reasons as the organization).
+
Project key and display name : *org.lfenergy.operatorfabric:operatorfabric-core-mock*
Then choose "Public" and click "Set Up".
. This redirects to the the following message :
https://sonarcloud.io/project/configuration?id=org.lfenergy.operatorfabric%3Aoperatorfabric-core-mock[We initialized your project on SonarCloud, now it's up to you to launch analyses!]
Now we need to provide Travis with a token to use to access SonarCloud.
. To generate a token, go to https://sonarcloud.io/account/security/[Account/Security]
+
There are two options to pass this token to Travis:
+
.. Option A: Define a new SONAR_TOKEN environment variable in the
https://travis-ci.org/opfab-mock/operatorfabric-core/settings[repository's settings in Travis], then use it in the
.travis.yml file as follows:
+
----
addons:
  sonarcloud:
    organization: "opfab-mock"
    token:
         secure: ${SONAR_TOKEN}
----
.. Option B: Encrypt this token using the travis gem:
+
----
travis encrypt XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
----
+
IMPORTANT: This has to be run at the root of the repository otherwise you get the following error: `Can't figure out GitHub repo name. Ensure you're in the repo directory, or specify the repo name via the -r option (e.g. travis <command> -r <owner>/<repo>)`
+
IMPORTANT: Do not use the --add option (to add the encrypted value directly to the .travis.yml file) as it changes
a lot of things in the file (remove comments, change indentation and quotes, etc.).
+
Paste the result (YYYY) in the .travis.yml file:
+
----
addons:
  sonarcloud:
    organization: "opfab-mock"
    token:
         secure: "YYYY"
----
+
Option A would be better as it's not necessary to make a new commit if the token needs to be changed, but it stopped
working suddenly, maybe as a result of a travis policy change regarding encryption.
https://opfab.atlassian.net/browse/OC-752[OC-752] was created to investigate.

IMPORTANT: There is still a SONAR_TOKEN environment variable defined in the Travis settings (with a dummy value)
because there is a test on its presence to decide whether sonar-scanner should be launched or
not (in the case of external PRs) (see https://opfab.atlassian.net/browse/OC-700[OC-700]
/ https://opfab.atlassian.net/browse/OC-507[OC-507]).

. Finally change the organization in .travis.yml file and the project key
in sonar-project.properties (replace the actual values with mock values).

NOTE: In travis.yml we launch the sonar-scanner command whereas the tutorials mention gradle sonarqube.
It looks like we're following https://sonarcloud.io/documentation/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/[this] which says that
"The SonarScanner is the scanner to use when there is no specific scanner for your build system."
But there is a https://sonarcloud.io/documentation/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-gradle/[specific scanner for Gradle]:
____
The SonarScanner for Gradle provides an easy way to start SonarCloud analysis of a Gradle project.
The ability to execute the SonarCloud analysis via a regular Gradle task makes it available anywhere Gradle is available
(CI service, etc.), without the need to manually download, setup, and maintain a SonarScanner installation.
The Gradle build already has much of the information needed for SonarCloud to successfully analyze a project.
By configuring the analysis based on that information, the need for manual configuration is reduced significantly.
____
-> This could make sonar easier to run locally and reduce the need for configuration
(see https://opfab.atlassian.net/browse/OC-754[OC-754]).

=== GitHub (documentation)

. Create a personal access token for GitHub (for the documentation). Its name is not important.
+
See https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line[GitHub documentation].
+
image::perso_access_token_doc.png[]

. Create a GH_DOC_TOKEN env variable
in https://travis-ci.org/opfab-mock/operatorfabric-core/settings[Travis settings for the operatorfabric-core repository]
, making it available to all branches.
+
image::adding_gh_doc_token_travis.png[]

=== DockerHub

. Create account opfabtechmock
. Create organization *lfeoperatorfabricmock*
. Change organization name in docker config in services.gradle
+
----
docker {
    name "lfeoperatorfabricmock/of-${project.name.toLowerCase()}"
    tags 'latest', dockerVersionTag
    labels (['project':"${project.group}"])
    files jar.archivePath, 'src/main/resources/bootstrap-docker.yml', '../../../src/main/docker/java-config-dependent-docker-entrypoint.sh'
    buildArgs(['JAR_FILE'       : "${jar.archiveName}",
               'http_proxy'     : apk.proxy.uri,
               'https_proxy'    : apk.proxy.uri,
               'HTTP_PROXY_AUTH': "basic:*:$apk.proxy.user:$apk.proxy.password"])
    dockerfile file("src/main/docker/Dockerfile")
}
----

. Add the opfabtechmock dockerhub account credentials as DOCKER_CLOUD_USER / DOCKER_CLOUD_PWD in Travis env variables
in settings (see GH_DOC_TOKEN above).

=== Updating the fork

To make the mock repositories catch up with the upstream (the real repositories) from time to time, follow
this procedure (the command line version), except you should do a rebase instead of a merge:
https://rick.cogley.info/post/update-your-forked-repository-directly-on-github/

== To Do
//TODO Handle those TODOs
There are a few "nice to have" things left to do.

. Make https://sonarcloud.io/organizations/opfab-mock/quality_profiles[quality profiles] match between mock and real sonar
. What about ui/main/sonar-project.properties with a different project key ? is it still used ?
. Make sure it is no longer used and delete opfab travis account (and remove rights from dockerhub)
. Remove commented out lines in .travis.yml
