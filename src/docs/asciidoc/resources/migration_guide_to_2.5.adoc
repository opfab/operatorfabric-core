== Send card

The API endpoint to send a card doesn't return CardCreationReport object anymore.
The endPoint `cards` now returns :

- status code 201 (Created) in case of success.
- status code 400 (Bad request) in case of a request with wrong data.

So if you use CardCreationReport object when you send card, you need to modify your code to not use it anymore and to test the status code returned.
