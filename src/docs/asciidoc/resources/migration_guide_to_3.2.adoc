= Migration Guide from release 3.1.0 to release 3.2.0

== Cache configuration for i18n files 

Add the following lines in your nginx.conf to avoid keeping in cache old translation files when migrating opfab

```
  location /ui/assets/i18n/ {
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache";
    alias /usr/share/nginx/html/assets/i18n/;
  }
```

see the reference nginx configuration file : https://github.com/opfab/operatorfabric-core/blob/master/config/docker/nginx.conf 

== Tag feed filter removal 

The feature to filter tags in the feed has been removed. In consequence, you can remove the following parameters in your web-ui.json configuration file: 

 * settings.tags.hide
 * settings.infos.hide.tags
