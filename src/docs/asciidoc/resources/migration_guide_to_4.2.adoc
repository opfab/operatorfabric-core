== Deletion of parameter displayConnectionCirclesInPreview

The parameter `displayConnectionCirclesInPreview` has been deleted. Now, in the usercard preview, users will see
which recipients entities are connected or not via badges : a blue badge if connected and a gray one if not.
This feature is provided for all users.
So you have to remove this parameter from the configuration file `web-ui.json`.
