= Migration Guide from release 3.14.0 to release 3.15.0

== CrossOrigin for GeoJSON

The option `feed.geomap.layer.geojson.crossOrigin`, used to set a cross-origin option when downloading GeoJSON, has been removed.

== `ui-menu.json` file

To be able to dynamically reload the navigation bar and its menus, instead of having `ui-menu.json` as a file in
the configuration directory, now the file can be created (and updated) via a POST
request to the endpoint `/businessconfig/uiMenu`.
