== Optimizing Nginx Configuration for Latency Reduction

An optimization has been introduced in the Nginx configuration to reduce latency. To implement this optimization in your `nginx.conf` you need to add in `location /cards/`  the directive `proxy_buffering off` 

For example : 

```
  location /cards/ {
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
    proxy_pass http://cards-consultation:2104/;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
  }
```
