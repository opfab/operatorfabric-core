= Migration Guide from release 4.2.0 to release 4.3.0


== ADMIN group 
Users belonging to 'ADMIN' group will not be automatically given admin rights anymore.
The admin rights will be set only if user is member of a group with ADMIN permission.

IMPORTANT: Before initiating the migration process, ensure that all users with administrative privileges are members of a group that has been explicitly granted the 'ADMIN' permission. Failing to do so may result in loss of the ability to administrate operator fabric
