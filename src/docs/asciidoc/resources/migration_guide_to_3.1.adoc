== Kafka date format

The signature for sending card dates via Kafka have been changed to better reflect the REST API. Instead
of sending the date in seconds since epoch, you can now use the Java Instant object. The following methods are affected:

* `startDate`
* `endDate`
* `lttd`
* `publishDate`
* `TimeSpan.setStart`
* `TimeSpan.setEnd`

For example the following code:

`Card card = Card.newBuilder().setStartDate(12345L).build();`

becomes:

`Card card = Card.newBuilder().setStartDate(Instant.now()).build();`
