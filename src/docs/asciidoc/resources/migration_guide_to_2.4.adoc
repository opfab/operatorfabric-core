= Migration Guide from release 2.3.0 to release 2.4.0

== Send card 

The API does not have anymore an endpoint to send an Array of card. 

- The endPoint `cards` now receive only one card 
- The endPoint `async/cards` does not longer exist 

So if you use to send card as array, you need to modify your code to send it one by one via endpoint `cards`

== Package name change

The name of the packages in the OperatorFabric code has been changed from `org.lfenergy.operatorfabric.*` to
`org.opfab.*` in preparation for an upload of the client library to Maven Central.
You need to update any code using the client library to reflect this name change.
