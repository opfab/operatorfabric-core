== Logging screen : Filter with tags list

As for archives screen, now you have to specify the list of tags you want to see in the filter of logging screen.
You have to set this list in the `web-ui.json` file, with the parameter `logging.filters.tags.list`. For example :

[source,json]
----
"logging": {
  "filters": {
    "tags": {
      "list": [
        {
          "label": "Label for tag 1",
          "value": "tag1"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
