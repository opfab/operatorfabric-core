:imagesdir: ../images

//TODO Explain how documentation is organized and conventions, how to generate it
Write docs with level 1 title (so they can be used on their own) + level offset (except for really short bits)

All includes are defined based on root dir

asciidoctor index.adoc -a imagesdir=images

Avoid long lines (give char number)

using custom ids : cumbersome but
1) you get a warning if duplicates rather than silently link to the wrong section
2) easier to find referenced text (ctrl-f on id)
3) it's a sign that the content is referenced somewhere else (if you're thinking of deleting/moving it)

defining label with the id doesn't work with relative links
[[my_id, text to display]]

ifdef::single-page-doc[<<card_structure, Card Structure>>]
ifndef::single-page-doc[<<{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/reference_doc/index.adoc#card_structure, Card Structure>>]

ifdef::single-page-doc[link:../api/cards/index.html#/archives[here]]
ifndef::single-page-doc[link:{gradle-rootdir}/documentation/current/api/cards/index.html#/archives[here]]

{gradle-rootdir} doesn't work for images (because resolved when the page is displayed and not when it is generated like links,
so didn't work because site structure doesn't match core structure?), hence the addition of docs subfolder

avoid links in https://opfab.github.io/documentation so they stay relative to the current version (except for release process )
