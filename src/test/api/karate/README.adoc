# operatorfabric-api-testing

Api testing with Karate DSL 

## Install needed jar

1. Download the latest `karate.jar` from link:++https://github.com/intuit/karate/releases/++[Karate github release page]
2. Put it in the karate directory, rename it to `karate.jar` to use it easily.

IMPORTANT: If your OperatorFabric instance is not running on localhost, you need to replace localhost with the address
of your running instance within the `karate-config.js` file.

## Usage

Run the following command lines form this folder.

### Run a feature
....
java -jar karate.jar myfeature.feature
....

The result will be available in the `target` repository.


### Non regression tests

You can launch operatorFabric non-regression tests via 3 scripts in src/test/api/karate:

- launchAllBusinessconfig.sh
- launchAllUsers.sh
- launchAllCards.sh

For the launchAllCards script to run properly, you need to start a third party test server : 

....
cd src/test/externalApp
gradle bootRun
....

To have the test passed, you need to have a clean Mongo DB database.

## Clean Up Mongo DB

### Connect to running instance

....
docker exec -it test-quality-environment_mongodb_1 mongo --username root --password password --authenticationDatabase admin
....

where `test-quality-environment_mongodb_1` is the  docker container name of the current MongoDB instance.

This command line opens directly the mongo shell of the mongoDB docker instance.

### Remove cards and archiveCards collections

The following commands, run into the mongo shell, remove the whole collections of `cards` and `archivedCards`

....
use operator-fabric
db.cards.remove({})
db.archivedCards.remove({})
....
