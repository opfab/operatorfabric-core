= Dummy Modbus Device

This module contains very simple application acting as a slave using the Modbus protocol. It uses
the https://github.com/kochedykov/jlibmodbus[jlibmodbus library] as well and is based on an
https://github.com/kochedykov/jlibmodbus/blob/master/examples/com/intelligt/modbus/examples/SimpleSlaveTCP.java[example]
from its repository.

== Configuration

The following properties can be configured in the properties file of the application:

|===
|name|default|mandatory?|Description

|modbus_client.port||yes|Port on which the device should be listening
|modbus_client.readTimeout|10000|no|Connexion timeout
|modbus_client.holdingRegistersSize|5|no|Number of registers on which the device accepts write orders. For example,
if the value is 5, the device will allow writing on registers 0 to 4.
|===

NOTE: The holdingRegisterSize aims to emulate the fact that on real Modbus devices, only some registers will be
configured, so the modbus device should return an exception if we attempt to write on a register to which no sound is
associated. However, currently we are using the BROADCAST mode, so you will see the exception in the dummy device logs,
but it won't be returned to the caller (OperatorFabric).
