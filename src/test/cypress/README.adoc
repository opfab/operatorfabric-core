= Cypress Tests ReadMe

NOTE: All paths for cd are given assuming you're starting from `$OF_HOME`.

== Installation

Before running Cypress tests for the first time you need to install it using NPM.

[source,bash]
----
cd src/test/cypress
npm install
----

== Cypress file structure

By default, all test files are located in `cypress/cypress/integration` but it is possible to put it on another directory

The `commands.js` file under `cypress/cypress/support` is used to create custom commands and overwrite existing commands.

== Launching the OpFab instance to test

=== Commands

You can launch the OpFab instance for Cypress tests either in dev or docker mode. The following commands launch the
instance in docker mode, just substitute `dev` for `docker` to launch it in dev mode.

[source,bash]
----
cd config/docker
docker-compose down <1>
./docker-compose-cypress.sh <2>
----
<1> Remove existing config/docker containers to avoid conflicts
<2> Start "Cypress-flavoured" containers

After you're done with your tests, you can stop and destroy containers (as it is better to start with fresh containers to avoid
side-effects from previous tests) with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
cd config/docker
docker-compose down
----

=== Explanation

The Cypress tests rely on a running OpFab instance that is an adaptation from the config/docker docker-compose file
(environment name, shorter time before lttd clock display, etc.).

The `generateUIConfigForCypress.sh` script performs this adaptation to create this base Cypress configuration.

This will create the following files under `config/cypress/ui-config`:

* ui-menu.json
* ui-menu-base.json
* web-ui.json
* web-ui-base.json

Where `XXX-base.json` and `XXX.json` are created by copying the corresponding `XXX.json` file for standard docker
configuration (found under `config/docker/ui-config`) and making the necessary adaptations needed for the cypress instance to
work well for the tests (changing the authentication mode, making all features visible, etc.).

Then, during the course of the cypress tests, the `XXX.json` files will be modified to test specific features
(for example, hiding a feature, defining a new menu, etc.). They are reset with the content of `XXX-base.json`
before each test or series of test.

The docker container relies on the `XXX.json` files under `config/cypress/ui-config`.

For convenience, the `generateUIConfigForCypress.sh` is launched as part of the `docker-compose-cypress.sh` scripts.

== Running existing tests

To launch the Cypress test runner:

[source,bash]
----
cd src/test/cypress
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
----

This will open the Cypress test runner. Either click on the test you want to run or `run all X tests` on the right to
run all existing tests.

NOTE: You can select the browser (and version) that you want to use from a dropdown list on the right. The list will
display the browsers that are currently installed on your computer (and supported by Cypress).

== Running tests on 4200 (ng serve)

Follow the steps described above in "Dev mode" to start a Cypress-flavoured OpFab instance in development mode, then
run ng serve to start a dynamically generated ui on port 4200:

[source,bash]
----
cd ui/main
ng serve
----

Then launch the Cypress test runner as follows:

To launch the Cypress test runner:

[source,bash]
----
cd src/test/cypress
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open --config baseUrl=http://localhost:4200
----

== Running tests with Gradle

The tests can also be run in command line mode using a Gradle task :

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runCypressTests
----

== Clearing MongoDB

If you want to start with a clean database (from the cards and archived cards point of view), you can purge the
associated collections through the MongoDB shell with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it docker_mongodb_1 bash
mongo "mongodb://root:password@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin&authMode=scram-sha1"
use operator-fabric
db.cards.remove({})
db.archivedCards.remove({})
----

== Current status of tests

All tests should be passing when run alone (i.e. not with run all specs) against empty card/archived cards collections.
However, tests in the "Flaky" folder can sometimes fail because they involve dates (round up errors for example).

== Creating new tests

Create a new XXXX.spec.js file under `cypress/cypress/integration`

NOTE: We will need to define a convention for naming and organizing tests.

=== Guidelines and tips

* Use the https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get#Get-in-within[find or within commands] rather than complex CSS
selectors to target descendants elements.
* If you want to access aliases using the `this` keyword, make sure you are using anonymous functions rather than fat
arrow functions, otherwise use cy.get('@myAlias') to access it asynchronously
(https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/variables-and-aliases#Avoiding-the-use-of-this[the documentation]
has recently been updated on this topic).
* When running tests, make sure that you are not connected to OpFab as it can cause unexpected behaviour with read
cards for example.
* When chaining a `should` assertion to a `cy.get` command that returns several elements, it will pass if it is true for
ANY of these elements. Use each + callback to check that an assertion is true on every element.
* `cy.contains` is a command, not an assertion. If you want to test the attribute, classes, content etc. of an element,
it's better to target the element by id or data attribute using a `cy.get()` command for example and then chain an
assertion with `should()`.
This way, you will get an expected/actual error message if the assertion fails, you will avoid false positives (text is
found in another sibling element) and hard to debug behaviour with retries.
* Be careful with `find()` (see #1751 for an example of issue that it can cause). See the Cypress documentation for
https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability#Only-the-last-command-is-retried[an
explanation] and https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability#Merging-queries[a less flaky alternative].


== Configuration

In `cypress.json`:

* `baseUrl`: The base url of the OperatorFabric instance you're testing against. It will be appended in front of any
    `visit` call.
* `env.host`: The host corresponding to the OperatorFabric instance you're testing against. It will be used for API
calls.
* `env.defaultWaitTime`: Using the custom-defined command cy.waitDefaultTime() instead of cy.wait(XXX) allows the wait
time to be changed globally for all steps to the value defined by this property.
