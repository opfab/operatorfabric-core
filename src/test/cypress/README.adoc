= Cypress Tests ReadMe

NOTE: All paths for cd are given assuming you're starting from `$OF_HOME`.

== Installation

Before running Cypress tests for the first time you need to install it using NPM.

[source,bash]
----
cd src/test/cypress
npm install
----

== Cypress file structure

By default, all test files are located in `cypress/cypress/integration` but it is possible to put it on another directory

The `commands.js` file under `cypress/cypress/support` is used to create custom commands and overwrite existing commands.

== Launching the OpFab instance to test

The Cypress test rely on a running OpFab instance that is an adaptation from the config/docker docker-compose file.
For example, as Cypress doesn't allow navigation to different origins within the same test, the OpFab instance needs
to use the `PASSWORD` authentication mode rather than `CODE`.

To launch such an instance:

[source,bash]
----
cd /config/docker
docker-compose down <1>
./docker-compose-cypress.sh <2>
----
<1> Remove existing config/docker containers to avoid conflicts
<2> Start "Cypress-flavoured" containers

NOTE: If you need to further adapt the Cypress instance, you can make changes to the `web-ui-cypress.json` and
`docker-compose.cypress.override.yml` files.

You also need to set up some perimeters and bundles for the tests. To do so:

----
cd /src/test/resources
loadTestConf.sh
----

After you're done with your tests, you can stop and destroy containers (as it is better to start with fresh containers to avoid
side-effects from previous tests) with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
cd /config/docker
docker-compose down
----
== Running existing tests

To launch the Cypress test runner:

[source,bash]
----
cd src/test/cypress
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
----

This will open the Cypress test runner. Either click on the test you want to run or `run all X tests` on the right to
run all existing tests.

NOTE: You can select the browser (and version) that you want to use from a dropdown list on the right. The list will
display the browsers that are currently installed on your computer (and supported by Cypress).

== Clearing MongoDB

If you want to start with a clean database (from the cards and archived cards point of view), you can purge the
associated collections through the MongoDB shell with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it docker_mongodb_1 bash
mongo "mongodb://root:password@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin&authMode=scram-sha1"
use operator-fabric
db.cards.remove({})
db.archivedCards.remove({})
----

== Current status of tests

All tests except timeline business periods are mostly passing when run against empty card/archived cards collections.
However, they are currently quite flaky especially when involving dates (round up errors for example).

== Creating new tests

Create a new XXXX.spec.js file under `cypress/cypress/integration`

NOTE: We will need to define a convention for naming and organizing tests.

Start writing tests, cypress is well documented https://docs.cypress.io/api/api/table-of-contents.html
