= Cypress Tests ReadMe

NOTE: All paths for cd are given assuming you're starting from `$OF_HOME`.

== Installation

Before running Cypress tests for the first time you need to install it using NPM.

[source,bash]
----
cd src/test/cypress
npm install
----

== Cypress file structure

By default, all test files are located in `cypress/cypress/integration` but it is possible to put it on another directory

The `commands.js` file under `cypress/cypress/support` is used to create custom commands and overwrite existing commands.

== Launching the OpFab instance to test

The Cypress test rely on a running OpFab instance that is an adaptation from the config/docker docker-compose file.
For example, as Cypress doesn't allow navigation to different origins within the same test, the OpFab instance needs
to use the `PASSWORD` authentication mode rather than `CODE`.

=== Full docker mode

To launch such an instance:

[source,bash]
----
cd config/docker
docker-compose down <1>
./docker-compose-cypress.sh <2>
----
<1> Remove existing config/docker containers to avoid conflicts
<2> Start "Cypress-flavoured" containers

NOTE: If you need to further adapt the Cypress instance, you can make changes to the `web-ui-cypress.json` and
`docker-compose.cypress.override.yml` files.

You also need to set up some perimeters and bundles for the tests. To do so:

----
cd src/test/resources
loadTestConf.sh
----

After you're done with your tests, you can stop and destroy containers (as it is better to start with fresh containers to avoid
side-effects from previous tests) with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
cd config/docker
docker-compose down
----

=== Dev mode

You can also launch operator-fabric in dev mode. To do so, follow the steps described above, substituting
`config/dev` for `config/docker`. Then run the core services with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
./bin/run_all.sh start
----

== Running existing tests

To launch the Cypress test runner:

[source,bash]
----
cd src/test/cypress
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
----

This will open the Cypress test runner. Either click on the test you want to run or `run all X tests` on the right to
run all existing tests.

NOTE: You can select the browser (and version) that you want to use from a dropdown list on the right. The list will
display the browsers that are currently installed on your computer (and supported by Cypress).

== Running tests on 4200 (ng serve)

Follow the steps described above in "Dev mode" to start a Cypress-flavoured OpFab instance in development mode, then
run ng serve to start a dynamically generated ui on port 4200:

[source,bash]
----
cd ui/main
ng serve
----

Then launch the Cypress test runner as follows:

To launch the Cypress test runner:

[source,bash]
----
cd src/test/cypress
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open --config baseUrl=http://localhost:4200
----

== Running tests with Gradle

The tests can also be run in command line mode using a Gradle task :

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew runCypressTests
----

== Clearing MongoDB

If you want to start with a clean database (from the cards and archived cards point of view), you can purge the
associated collections through the MongoDB shell with the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it docker_mongodb_1 bash
mongo "mongodb://root:password@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin&authMode=scram-sha1"
use operator-fabric
db.cards.remove({})
db.archivedCards.remove({})
----

== Current status of tests

All tests should be passing when run alone (i.e. not with run all specs) against empty card/archived cards collections.
However, tests in the "Flaky" folder can sometimes fail because they involve dates (round up errors for example).

== Creating new tests

Create a new XXXX.spec.js file under `cypress/cypress/integration`

NOTE: We will need to define a convention for naming and organizing tests.

=== Guidelines and tips

* Use the https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get#Get-in-within[find or within commands] rather than complex CSS
selectors to target descendants elements.
* If you want to access aliases using the `this` keyword, make sure you are using anonymous functions rather than fat
arrow functions, otherwise use cy.get('@myAlias') to access it asynchronously
(https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/variables-and-aliases#Avoiding-the-use-of-this[the documentation]
has recently been updated on this topic).
* When running tests, make sure that you are not connected to OpFab as it can cause unexpected behaviour with read
cards for example.
* When chaining a `should` assertion to a `cy.get` command that returns several elements, it will pass if it is true for
ANY of these elements. Use each + callback to check that an assertion is true on every element.
* `cy.contains` is a command, not an assertion. If you want to test the attribute, classes, content etc. of an element,
it's better to target the element by id or data attribute using a `cy.get()` command for example and then chain an
assertion with `should()`.
This way, you will get an expected/actual error message if the assertion fails, you will avoid false positives (text is
found in another sibling element) and hard to debug behaviour with retries.

== Configuration

In `cypress.json`:

* `baseUrl`: The base url of the OperatorFabric instance you're testing against. It will be appended in front of any
    `visit` call.
* `env.host`: The host corresponding to the OperatorFabric instance you're testing against. It will be used for API
calls.
* `env.defaultWaitTime`: Using the custom-defined command cy.waitDefaultTime() instead of cy.wait(XXX) allows the wait
time to be changed globally for all steps to the value defined by this property.
