= Customizing browser notification sounds

The sounds used by default by the browser to signal a card of a given severity
can be found under `ui/main/src/assets/sounds` in the core repository and are packaged in the `web-ui` docker image.

To customize these sounds, you can put the files in the current directory and mount that directory as a volume for
the web-ui container:

.Under web-ui.volumes, add:
[source,yaml]
```
- "./custom-sounds:/usr/share/nginx/html/assets/sounds"
```

NOTE: When testing, if the sounds seem not to be taken into account try clearing your browser's cache.

IMPORTANT: The name of the file needs to match the existing file (for example `alarm.mp3`).
